// This file implements the strict WHOLE-CATALOG load behind the R1/C6 acceptance gate
// (#1750). C6 states: "There is no validate command: the simulator validates whatever it
// reads and fails with a message naming the file and the problem. CI runs a load over every
// catalog entry, which is the same code path."
//
// Two consequences shape the design:
//
//  1. NO validate command, and no bespoke validator. Every namespace a run consumes is
//     loaded through the very function the run uses — models through
//     resolveModelConfigInCatalog + latency.GetModelConfig, workload presets through
//     readCatalogPresetWorkload, storage devices through loadCatalogStorageDevices. Only the
//     two namespaces no run reads yet — models/<name>/model.yaml (identity/provenance) and
//     hardware/<gpu>.yaml (calibration still ships in the in-repo hardware_config.json) —
//     get a reader here, and the hardware one delegates its strict key policy to
//     latency.ParseHardwareCalibEntries rather than re-deriving it.
//
//  2. The GATE is a test, not a subcommand: cmd/catalog_load_test.go drives loadCatalog
//     against the committed fixture catalog (testdata/catalog) unconditionally, and
//     scripts/catalog-load-gate.sh drives it against a pinned blis-catalog checkout. The
//     workflow job that calls that script is a PENDING HUMAN EDIT to
//     .github/workflows/ci.yml — the delivery loop's token cannot push workflow files — and its
//     body is quoted verbatim in the script's header.
//
// SCOPE BOUNDARY, stated because it is the one place this file could be misread as doing
// less than the issue asks: the completeness rule ("a models/<name>/ dir missing either
// config.json or model.yaml fails") and the deployment-fact rule are properties of the
// CATALOG AS A WHOLE, enforced here. `blis run` is deliberately NOT tightened to require
// model.yaml: it resolves exactly ONE model and its refusal diagnostics are settled
// behaviour (#1771/#1774/#1776), so making a run depend on a provenance file it never reads
// would break working scratch clones for no fidelity gain. The config.json half of the rule
// IS the run path — a model whose config.json is absent or unparseable fails a run and fails
// this gate through the same code.

//  1. it states no deployment fact, at any nesting depth, in ANY document of the file;
//  2. it holds exactly one document.
//
// Rule 2 is not tidiness. EVERY typed reader in BLIS decodes exactly ONE document — this file's
// model and hardware readers, readCatalogPresetWorkload (#1769), parseCatalogStorageDevices
// (#1770) — so content after a `---` separator is read by nothing: not the strict-key check,
// not a required-field check, not a run. That is the silent-drop defect strict parsing exists
// to prevent (R10) one level up from a single key, so a stream is refused rather than
// half-read. An EMPTY trailing document (a file ending in `---`) carries nothing and does not
// count: yaml.v3 yields a nil document for it, and refusing that would reject a harmless
// separator.
//
// Rule 1 is still checked over every document, so the specific "this states a deployment fact"
// diagnostic wins over the generic stream one — the same precedence
