//
// TP=1 forces the attribution, which is what makes this shape the right probe. There is no
// TP collective at all (tpAllReduceBasis returns 0 at tp <= 1) and tMoEReduce additionally
// requires tp > 1, so the all-reduce leg is 0 in BOTH modes — the gate change cannot improve
// this shape, it can only ADD the dispatch term. Routed-expert COMPUTE is scoped by
// moeGroup = TP·DP = 1 in both modes (asserted separately in
