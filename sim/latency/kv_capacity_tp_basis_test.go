// Tests for the TP BASIS of CalculateKVBlocks' block-count division (#1846).
//
// The bug this file guards against: the memory budget is a TOTAL across the rank's tp
// GPUs, while KVBytesPerToken returns a PER-GPU cost. Dividing the first by the second
// inflated the auto-calculated pool by ~tp — 8.7x on a granite-5.0-230b-sft / H200 / TP8
// deployment whose real vLLM pool was 480,473 blocks, enough to make the KV-exhaustion
// knee of a capacity study disappear entirely.
//
// Why a whole file of its own: the bug was invisible for months because EVERY
// absolute-value CalculateKVBlocks test ran at TP=1, where the factor is exactly 1 (a
// genuine no-op), and every TP>1 test asserted only relative laws (ratios, monotonicity,
// EP/DP deltas) that the inflated count satisfies just as well as the correct one. The
// four laws below are each chosen to be violated by a factor-of-tp error:
//
//  1. TP=8 / TP=16 known-answer golden values (absolute, exact ==).
//  2. The per-TP slope law that validates those goldens from first principles, with no
//     reference to the implementation's own weight/overhead arithmetic.
//  3. Physical realizability: the pool must fit on the GPUs it claims to live on.
//  4. Agreement with the two REAL MEASURED pools the bug was reported against, within a
//     stated tolerance (the last sentence of #1846 acceptance criterion 2).
//  5. TP=1 byte-identity (INV-6) — the correction must be inert on one GPU.
//
// One cross-cutting caveat, which every test below states at its own site: KVBytesPerToken
// divides the model's KV bytes by tp even when numKVHeads < tp, where vLLM would instead
// replicate KV heads per rank (a documented optimistic approximation that predates #1846
// and is out of its scope). A TP=16 assertion on an 8-KV-head fixture therefore pins the
// aggregate UNITS basis — the thing this file guards — without being a physically
// realizable per-GPU derivation. The llama-2-7b fixture (32 KV heads) has numKVHeads
// divisible by 16, so it carries the first-principles claim at TP=16 that #1846
// acceptance criterion 2 asks for.

// The law: for a fixed model on a fixed GPU, the only tp-dependent quantities in the

// overhead (0.6 GiB x tp). Model weights and activation are tp-independent per rank, so
// they CANCEL between any two tp values >= 2:
//
//	blocks(b) - blocks(a) == (gpu_mem x util - 0.6) x (b - a) x 2^30 / blockCostBytes
//
// where blockCostBytes is what one block of the pool costs across the whole TP group
// (per-GPU bytes x tp) — a tp-invariant equal to the whole model's per-token KV bytes x
// block size on the MHA/GQA path. Both sides are computed here from published hardware
// numbers and the KV shape alone.
//
// WHAT THE LAW DOES AND DOES NOT CERTIFY. blockCostBytes is tp-invariant whether or not
// numKVHeads >= tp, because KVBytesPerToken divides by tp unconditionally and this law
// multiplies that back. So on the three 8-KV-head fixtures the tp=16 step is a statement
// about the division's units basis, not about a physically realizable per-GPU cost — at
// 8 KV heads and tp=16 vLLM would replicate heads and the real per-GPU cost is 2x what
// the invariance guard below measures (kv_capacity.go's documented optimistic
// approximation, out of #1846's scope). The llama-2-7b (32 KV heads, exact at every tp
// here) fixture carries the law on the exact per-GPU basis, so the slope is validated in
// both regimes rather than only the approximate one.
//
// This law is exactly what the bug broke. Pre-#1846 the block count carried a factor of
// tp, so the left-hand side grew super-linearly in tp and missed the right-hand side by
// hundreds of thousands of blocks. tp >= 2 throughout, because tp=1 uses the smaller
// 0.15 GiB/GPU non-torch constant and so is not on this line.
//
// It ALSO pins the activation-memory basis (#1846 acceptance criterion 3): activation is
// subtracted ONCE per rank, not x tp. Were it x tp, the slope would be
// (gpu_mem x util - 0.6 - activationGiB) per tp and every step would be off by
// thousands of blocks. The anti-assertion below states that explicitly, so the

//
// Each case asserts two independent things:
//
//  1. THE MEASURED-POOL TOLERANCE. The corrected count must sit inside a band around the
//     engine's own pool. The band is not symmetric and not the same on both GPUs, because
//     two residuals #1846 explicitly scopes out push the estimate high:
//     - activation is charged once per replica rather than per GPU, under-subtracting
//     (tp-1) x 8 GiB here (#1848); and
//     - the fixed overhead constants are a larger fraction of the budget when weights
//     nearly fill the card, which the issue's notes call out as the reason the over-count
//     was 8.7x on a 141 GiB H200 but 10.9x on an 80 GiB H100 ("out of scope for this
//     issue").
//     So the ceiling is 1.10x on H200 (the issue's own ~1.09x prediction) and 1.40x on the
//     cramped H100. The floor is 0.90x on both: nothing in the fix may push the pool BELOW
//     a measured one, and in particular a correction applied twice would land at ~0.14x.
//
//  2. FIXTURE FIDELITY. Undoing the fix (got x tp, which reconstructs the pre-#1846
//     numerator/per-GPU-cost division to within tp blocks) must land on the pre-fix count
//     BLIS actually printed for that deployment. This is what makes the stand-in config
//     admissible: it is not "a 230B model someone made up", it is a config pinned by two
//     independent real measurements, either of which it would miss if the shape were wrong.
