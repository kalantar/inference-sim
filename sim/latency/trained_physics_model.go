// TrainedPhysicsModel implements a physics-informed latency model that combines
// analytical roofline performance bounds with learned correction coefficients.
//
// # Model Architecture
//
// The model uses roofline analysis as a physics-based prior, computing analytical
// bounds for compute (FLOPs) and memory bandwidth (HBM transfers) for each operation:
// attention, MLP, weight loading, KV cache access, and TP communication. Learned
// coefficients (α, β) correct these analytical estimates to match observed latencies.
//
// # Step-Time Formula
//
// The model supports 8 through 11 beta coefficients for increasing fidelity. The
// 10-beta form (bundled default) plus the optional 11th β_EP is shown below; the 8-
// and 9-beta forms collapse the prefill/decode compute/memory splits into β₁·max(...)
// and β₂·max(...) respectively (β_EP still defaults in — see the constructor).
//
// 11-beta (prefill + decode split, MoE DP/EP comm):
//
//	T_step = β₁ₐ·T_pf_compute + β₁ᵦ·T_pf_kv + β₂ₐ·T_dc_compute + β₂ᵦ·T_dc_kv
//	         + β₃·T_weight + β₄·(T_tp_attn + T_tp_denseFFN + T_moe_reduce)
//	         + β_EP·T_moe_dispatch + β₅·L + β₆·B + β₇ + β₈·nMoE
//
// Where:
//   - T_pf_compute: Prefill compute time (FlashAttention FLOPs + MLP FLOPs)
//   - T_pf_kv: Prefill KV cache write bandwidth
//   - T_dc_compute: Decode compute time (single-token attention + MLP)
//   - T_dc_kv: Decode KV cache read bandwidth (past tokens)
//   - T_weight: Model weight loading bandwidth (per-step fixed cost)
//   - T_tp_attn, T_tp_denseFFN: attention / dense-FFN tensor-parallel all-reduce
//     (the pre-#1419 monolithic T_tp, split so DP scales each by /dp)
//   - T_moe_reduce: MoE-FFN all-reduce, charged at DP=1, TP>1 with expert parallelism
//     OFF (#1419, #1548)
//   - T_moe_dispatch: MoE dispatch/combine all-to-all, charged at DP>1 OR with expert
//     parallelism ON (#1419, #1548). Exactly one of these two is charged for an MoE model.
//   - L: Number of transformer layers
//   - B: Batch size (number of requests)
//   - nMoE: Number of MoE layers (0 for dense models)
//
// # Beta Coefficients (Roofline Corrections + Overheads)
//
// β₁ (or β₁ₐ): Prefill compute correction (dimensionless, ~1.0)
//
//	Corrects analytical FlashAttention + MLP FLOP estimates. Accounts for kernel
//	efficiency, memory access patterns, and instruction-level parallelism.
//
// β₁ᵦ (β₉): Prefill memory correction (dimensionless, ~0.0 when compute-bound)
//
//	Corrects KV cache write bandwidth. Typically zero since prefill is compute-bound.
//
// β₂ (or β₂ₐ): Decode compute correction (dimensionless, ~0.0 when memory-bound)
//
//	Corrects single-token attention + MLP FLOPs. Typically zero since decode is
//	memory-bound (bandwidth-limited by KV cache reads).
//
// β₂ᵦ (β₁₀): Decode memory correction (dimensionless, ~1.0-2.0)
//
//	Corrects KV cache read bandwidth. Primary decode bottleneck.
//
// β₃: Weight loading correction (dimensionless, ~1.0-1.5)
//
//	Corrects model weight bandwidth (loaded once per step). Accounts for cache
//	effects, prefetching, and HBM contention with KV cache traffic.
//
// β₄: TP All-Reduce correction (dimensionless, ~0.3-0.8)
//
//	Corrects tensor-parallel communication overhead. Absorbs NVLink/HBM bandwidth
//	ratio and collective communication efficiency (ring, tree, etc.).
//
// β₅: Per-layer overhead (µs/layer)
//
//	Fixed overhead per transformer layer: kernel launch latency, CUDA graph overhead,
//	residual connections, layer normalization. Typically ~30-60 µs/layer.
//
// β₆: Per-request overhead (µs/request)
//
//	Scheduling and dispatch overhead per request in batch: queue management, attention
//	mask construction, token ID lookup. Typically ~3-5 µs/request.
//
// β₇: Per-step constant overhead (µs/step)
//
//	Fixed overhead per step independent of batch/model size: CUDA synchronization,
//	sampler invocation, logging. Typically ~100-200 µs/step.
//
// β₈: MoE-layer overhead (µs/MoE-layer, architecture-aware)
//
//	Per-MoE-layer overhead: router gating, token permutation, expert-parallel
//	communication. Applies only to interleaved architectures (InterleaveMoELayerStep > 0).
//	Zero for uniform MoE (all layers are MoE) and dense models. Typically ~400-500 µs/layer.
//
// # Alpha Coefficients (API/Framework Overheads)
//
// α₀: QueueingTime (µs)
//
//	Fixed per-request API processing: HTTP parsing, request validation, queue
//	insertion. Independent of model/batch size. Typically ~15,000 µs (15ms).
//
// α₁: PostDecodeFixedOverhead (µs)
//
//	Fixed per-request post-decode overhead: detokenization setup, finish reason
//	determination, response serialization. Typically ~777 µs.
//
// α₂: OutputTokenProcessingTime (µs/token)
//
//	Per-output-token overhead: streaming token transmission, incremental detokenization.
//	Typically ~50 µs/token.
//
// # Architecture-Aware Features
//
//  1. Interleaved MoE/Dense Layers: Models like Scout alternate MoE and dense layers.
//     The model splits FLOPs and weight bandwidth calculations by layer type, using
//     DenseIntermediateDim for dense layers and MoEExpertFFNDim for MoE layers.
//     β₈ overhead applies only to MoE layers in interleaved architectures.
//
//  2. Quantization-Aware Weights: Uses EffectiveWeightBytesPerParam for weight
//     bandwidth (e.g., 1 byte for FP8, 0.5 for W4A16), while KV cache always uses
//     FP16 (2 bytes). Automatically selects TFlopsFP8 for FP8 models on H100.
//
//  3. Tensor Parallelism Scaling: All compute and bandwidth terms are divided by TP
//     degree, while β₄ captures All-Reduce communication overhead explicitly.
//
//  4. Hybrid Attention (#1636): Models like Kimi-K3 interleave full-attention (MLA)
//     layers with linear-attention (Kimi Delta Attention) layers. The sequence-length-
//     dependent attention cost — the O(context)/O(N²) attention-score compute and the
//     growing-KV read/write bandwidth — is charged over the full-attention layers only
//     (numKVBearingLayers). The remaining KDA layers charge a linear-attention cost:
//     O(N) in prefill, O(state) per token in decode (context-independent). No-op for
//     non-hybrid models (numKVBearingLayers == numLayers). See numKVBearingLayers.

	// FLOP convention (4·h·(...)·d_head) and the existing β₁ₐ/β₂ₐ compute coefficients —

	// (linear_attn_config is NOT re-parsed here — the KDA count is derived from

	// read/write is context-independent and small, and is left folded into the per-layer
	// overhead β₅·L (charged over ALL layers) rather than given a separate fabricated
	// state-bandwidth coefficient. A precise KDA state-bandwidth term is a calibration
	// follow-up. KDA layer WEIGHTS remain charged as full attention (out of scope,

	//
	// epOn is "expert parallelism is really in force here": an MoE model with
	// --enable-expert-parallel AND an EP group wider than one GPU. It makes the toggle
	// step-time-LIVE by moving the MoE-FFN communication boundary, which mirrors what
	// vLLM actually does rather than adding a term:
	//
	//   EP off → the routed experts are TENSOR-sharded and replicated per DP rank, so the
	//            MoE FFN output is completed by a TP all-reduce (tMoEReduce).
	//   EP on  → each rank owns WHOLE experts out of the EP group, so tokens reach their
	//            owner by a dispatch/combine all-to-all (tMoEDispatch) instead.
	//
	// There is deliberately NO second additive comm term: the two existing terms are
	// mutually exclusive and epOn only moves the boundary between them (adding a term
	// would double-charge the DP>1 dispatch cost the model already prices, #1530).
	//
	// expertShardGroup is the group routed-expert WEIGHTS are sharded over
	// (EffectiveExpertShardGroupSize). It is NOT moeGroup: routed-expert COMPUTE is
	// EP-mode-invariant (with EP on, G GPUs jointly process the whole group's tokens, so
	// per-GPU FLOPs land on the same T_local·k/TP as tensor-sharding does), while the
	// per-GPU WEIGHT footprint falls from num_experts/TP to num_experts/EP. Conflating
	// them would divide compute by the EP group too and under-charge it by DP.
	//
	// It also sizes the dispatch/combine collective, because the all-to-all runs over the
	// expert-owning group.
	//
	// Inertness, stated precisely (the INV-6/INV-BC-DP1 boundary). With expert parallelism
	// OFF — and for every dense model, whose isMoE gate forces it — epOn is false and
	// expertShardGroup == moeGroup, so StepTime is bit-for-bit unchanged from a pre-#1548
	// build. That is the byte-identity guarantee.
	//
	// It does NOT extend to EP-ON configs, which were expressible before #1548 and whose
	// step time this feature deliberately changes — that IS the feature. The one exception is
	// documented and tested: at DP=1 on the all-gather comm family (vLLM's default) EP-on and
	// EP-off come out numerically EQUAL, because all-gather+reduce-scatter moves exactly the
	// ring-all-reduce volume and β_EP defaults to β₄. On a modular all-to-all backend at the
	// same DP=1 they differ (see TestStepTime_EPReplacesReduceWithDispatch), so "EP-on is

	// expertWeightShardGroup is expertShardGroup with the "a loaded rank holds one WHOLE

	// different bounds:
	//
	//   - WEIGHTS (this field) cannot be divided by more ranks than there are experts. At
	//     EP=16 over 8 experts, num_experts/EP = 0.5 charges half an expert's bytes to a GPU
	//     that in reality holds one whole expert — modelling memory that does not exist.
	//     The KV-capacity model already clamps this exact divisor (resolveExpertShardSize),
	//     so leaving step time unclamped would falsify the agreement between them.
	//   - The DISPATCH/COMBINE collective (expertShardGroup, unclamped) genuinely runs over
	//     every rank in the group, however few experts there are.
	//
	// The clamp is applied ONLY when expert parallelism is on. Under EP-off the experts are
	// TENSOR-sharded, so a rank really does hold a FRACTION of every expert and a
	// sub-one-expert charge is correct — clamping there would both be wrong physics and

	//
	// Cross-node cost has two halves, both frozen at construction (nothing re-reads
	// placement on the hot path).
	//
	// The SIZE-DEPENDENT half is a bandwidth penalty: tpSpanScale / moeSpanScale (from
	// spanScalesFor) reduce the effective link bandwidth for the TP-group collectives
	// and for MoE dispatch/combine respectively. A value of 1 — single-node placement,
	// an uncalibrated interconnect, or (for a model built by struct literal) the unset
	// zero — means no penalty.
	//
	// The SIZE-INDEPENDENT half is tpCrossNodeLatencyUs / moeCrossNodeLatencyUs: the
	// analytic-hop-count cost of one cross-node collective, n_steps·α_hop·S (#1694 —
	// n_steps = crossNodeRingHops or crossNodeAll2AllHops of the placed node span, α_hop
	// the per-fabric InterNodeHopLatencyUs, S the deployment serialization multiplier).
	// Charged per comm unit and 0 unless the group actually spans nodes AND the GPU
	// declares a latency. Both halves ride the same learned coefficient as the term they
	// join. These fields already fold in n_steps and S (frozen at construction), so the
	// charge sites just multiply by the per-layer collective count.
	//
	// The penalties are consumed through the tpCommBwUs / moeCommBwUs ACCESSORS rather
	// than precomputed divisors. That is deliberate: a precomputed divisor is 0 in a
	// model built by struct literal (as several tests in this package do), which would
	// make the divisor infinite and silently DELETE the communication term — the one way
	// this feature could remove cost instead of adding it. The accessors return bwHbmUs
	// itself, bit-for-bit, whenever a penalty is inert, so StepTime is byte-identical to
	// a pre-#1530 build (INV-6/INV-BC-DP1), at the cost of one comparison on a path that
	// already does dozens of flops. A denormal BwPeakTBs combined with an enormous
	// penalty could still underflow the effective bandwidth toward 0; clampToInt64

// ringSpanScale prices a RING collective (all-reduce, or the equivalent
// all-gather + reduce-scatter pair) over groupSize ranks placed per topo.
//
// The derivation is the HIERARCHICAL (two-level) algorithm NCCL uses for a
// multi-node all-reduce, and that choice is load-bearing. With G = n·g ranks (n
// nodes of g), the collective is an intra-node reduce-scatter+all-gather over the g
// ranks on a node — 2(g-1)/g·S bytes on the fast on-node link — followed by an
// inter-node all-reduce of the REDUCED S/g chunk across the n nodes, i.e.
// 2(n-1)/n·S/g bytes on the fabric (per GPU, since InterNodeBwGBps is a per-GPU
// fabric share). Normalizing by the flat single-node baseline 2(G-1)/G·S and
// substituting G = n·g simplifies exactly to spanScale(n-1, G-1, ratio).
//
// The identity is exact rather than approximate because hierarchical all-reduce
// moves exactly the same per-rank bytes as a flat ring: 2(g-1)/g + 2(n-1)/(n·g) ==
// 2(G-1)/G. That is also why the result is exactly 1 at ratio == 1.
//
// Assumption and failure mode: if NCCL instead ran a FLAT ring across the node
// boundary, every step would be throttled by the slowest link and the penalty would
// be ≈ ratio (9× rather than 1.53× for TP=16 over two H100 nodes) — an order of
// magnitude more. Measured two-node H100 all-reduce bus-bandwidth degradation
// (~1.3–1.5×) matches the hierarchical model, which is why it is the one used here.
// Note also that the "of G-1 hops, n-1 cross a boundary" reading of the formula is
// an interpretation of the result, NOT the derivation — it does not hold for a flat
// ring, so do not reapply it where the hierarchical algorithm does not.
//
// The G = n·g substitution is exact whenever the node size divides the group, which

// requires tp % gpus_per_node == 0). For the lumped MoE group it is an approximation

	// rank] = residentCount · activatedFraction(B) exactly, for any balanced placement of the
	// experts (BalancedPlacement is balanced by construction). What is approximate lies
	// elsewhere, and all three of these vanish at saturation, where the fraction is 1 and the
	// term recovers #1419's resident-count charge exactly:
	//
	//   - B is THIS step's token population. With a single ModelHardwareConfig at DP>1 that
	//     is already the group-wide count the /dp divisors above presuppose (placement.Resolve
	//     names the parameter globalTokens), which is the right B for all-to-all dispatch: a
	//     rank's experts are activated by the whole group's tokens. Under DP-as-placement
	//     (#1531/#1556) the two separate — the replica runs dp==1 over its OWN batch while
	//     expertWeightShardGroup is the wider LOGICAL EP width — so B understates the tokens
	//     that really dispatch here and the fraction is charged low below saturation.
	//   - It prices the EXPECTATION, not a realized per-step distinct-expert count. The
	//     relative spread around it is widest when a rank holds few whole experts (EP-on over
