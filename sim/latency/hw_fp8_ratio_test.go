// hw_fp8_ratio_test.go — the dense FP8:BF16 peak-FLOPs ratio guard (#1829).
//
// `TFlopsPeak` and `TFlopsFP8` must be read out of the SAME column of a GPU datasheet.
// NVIDIA quotes each tensor-core rate twice — a dense figure and a 2x-larger
// "with sparsity" figure — and the bundled L40S entry mixed the two: `TFlopsPeak`
// 362.05 was dense BF16 while `TFlopsFP8` 1466.0 was FP8 *with sparsity*, so BLIS
// shipped an L40S whose FP8 compute ceiling was double the real one. Nothing caught it,
// because each number is individually plausible and the roofline model consumes them
// independently (sim/latency/roofline.go picks TFlopsFP8 whenever the weights are
// 1 byte/param). blis-catalog fixed its copy in blis-catalog#2 / #1738; this repository's
// table was never propagated back.
//
// What makes the mix detectable is the RATIO. FP8 tensor-core throughput is exactly
// double BF16 on every part BLIS models — Hopper (H100/H200 1979/989.5 = 2.0x), Ada
// (L40S 733/362.05 = 2.02x, the small excess being datasheet clock rounding), and
// Blackwell — and sparsity is itself exactly a 2x multiplier. So a convention mix cannot
// land in band: taking FP8 from the sparse column reads ~4x, and taking BF16 from the
// sparse column (the mirror-image slip) reads ~1x. Both directions are rejected here,
// naming the GPU, which is the part an operator needs in a file of a dozen entries.
//
// The band itself lives in production code, not here: latency.DenseFP8RatioWarning is the
// single home for the rule (R23) and latency.ValidateHardwareCalibEntry calls it, so the
// check reaches every hardware table BLIS reads — the bundled file, a catalog
// hardware/<gpu>.yaml entry, and a user's own file — rather than only the committed table
// this file fences. These tests assert against that same function, so there is no second
// copy of the band to drift.
