# Quick Start

Run your first BLIS simulation in 30 seconds.

No credentials or network access are needed to *run* a simulation: BLIS reads each model's architecture from a local checkout of the model catalog and makes no HuggingFace requests. (`HF_TOKEN` matters only if you are downloading a new — possibly gated — model's `config.json` by hand to add a catalog entry.)

## Locate the model catalog

Every `blis run` / `blis replay` must be told where the **model catalog** is — a directory
holding a `models/<short-name>/config.json` for each catalogued model. The authoritative
catalog is the [`blis-catalog`](https://github.com/inference-sim/blis-catalog) repository;
clone it once and point BLIS at the clone root. There is **no default and no
search path**: supply `--catalog <path>` or set `BLIS_CATALOG` (the flag wins when both are
set), or the run is refused naming both forms.

```bash
git clone --branch 0.1.1 --depth 1 https://github.com/inference-sim/blis-catalog.git
export BLIS_CATALOG=$PWD/blis-catalog   # or pass --catalog on every command
```

The examples below (and elsewhere in these docs) assume you have exported it.

The clone pins release tag `0.1.1` — the catalog version BLIS is tested against — so a later
catalog release cannot change what a fresh clone hands your build. See
[Catalog compatibility](installation.md#catalog-compatibility) for why, and for how to move
to a newer catalog release deliberately.

## Single-Instance Simulation

```bash
./blis run --model qwen/qwen3-14b --hardware H100 --tp 1
```

This runs 100 requests through a single inference instance using the default trained-physics latency model for Qwen3 14B on an H100 GPU with TP=1.

!!! note "A model runs only if it is catalogued"
    BLIS reads the model's `config.json` from the catalog located by `--catalog` / `BLIS_CATALOG` (above) and never fetches or writes it at run time. A model with no catalog entry is refused, naming the path its entry belongs at — so runs are offline and reproducible, and running an unknown model can never quietly add a catalog entry. To use a model that is not yet catalogued, commit its `config.json` at `<catalog>/models/<model>/config.json`, or point `--catalog` at a scratch clone that has it.

!!! note "`--hardware` and `--tp` are required"
    BLIS does not infer the deployment. Omitting either flag is refused by name rather than filled in from a per-model default, so every reported number belongs to a deployment you chose.

### Reading the Output

BLIS prints diagnostic logs to stderr and results to stdout. You'll see log lines (prefixed with `INFO` or `WARN`) followed by a `=== Simulation Metrics ===` header and pretty-printed JSON:

**Latency metrics** (all in milliseconds, reported as mean/p90/p95/p99):

| Field | What It Measures |
|-------|-----------------|
| `ttft_mean_ms`, `ttft_p99_ms` | **Time to First Token** — how long until the first output token is generated. Lower is better for interactive use. |
| `e2e_mean_ms`, `e2e_p99_ms` | **End-to-End latency** — total time from request arrival to final output token. |
| `itl_mean_ms`, `itl_p99_ms` | **Inter-Token Latency** — time between consecutive output tokens. Lower means smoother streaming. |
| `scheduling_delay_p99_ms` | Wait time from request arrival until processing begins (includes any queueing). |

**Throughput:**

| Field | What It Measures |
|-------|-----------------|
| `responses_per_sec` | Completed requests per second. |
| `tokens_per_sec` | Output tokens generated per second. |
| `completed_requests` | How many requests finished within the simulation window. |
| `total_input_tokens`, `total_output_tokens` | Total tokens processed across all completed requests. |

**Health indicators:**

| Field | What It Measures |
|-------|-----------------|
| `preemption_count` | Number of times a running request was evicted to make room for others. Non-zero suggests the system is overloaded. |
| `dropped_unservable` | Requests rejected because they were too large for the configured memory or context length. |
| `still_queued`, `still_running` | Requests not yet completed when the simulation ended. Non-zero means the workload outlasted the simulation window. |

## Cluster Mode

Scale to 4 instances with routing:

```bash
./blis run \
  --model qwen/qwen3-14b --hardware H100 --tp 1 \
  --num-instances 4 \
  --routing-policy weighted \
  --rate 100 --num-requests 500
```

This simulates a 4-instance cluster receiving 100 requests/second. The `weighted` routing policy uses the default scorer profile (`precise-prefix-cache:2, queue-depth:1, kv-utilization:1`) to distribute requests across instances.

!!! note "Multi-instance output format"
    In cluster mode, BLIS prints one JSON block per instance plus a cluster-level summary (5 blocks total for 4 instances). The cluster summary has `"instance_id": "cluster"`. If piping to `jq`, use `--slurp` to handle multiple JSON objects: `./blis run ... 2>/dev/null | jq --slurp '.[] | select(.instance_id == "cluster")'` to extract the cluster summary.

## Try Different Configurations

```bash
# Higher traffic rate
./blis run --model qwen/qwen3-14b --hardware H100 --tp 1 \
  --num-instances 4 --rate 500 --num-requests 2000

# With decision tracing (see where each request was routed)
./blis run --model qwen/qwen3-14b --hardware H100 --tp 1 \
  --num-instances 4 --rate 100 --num-requests 500 \
  --trace-level decisions --summarize-trace

# With trained-physics mode (recommended for new models)
./blis run --model qwen/qwen3-14b \
  --latency-model trained-physics --hardware H100 --tp 1 \
  --num-instances 4 --rate 100 --num-requests 500

# With pure roofline mode (analytical, no learned corrections)
./blis run --model qwen/qwen3-14b \
  --latency-model roofline --hardware H100 --tp 1 \
  --num-instances 4 --rate 100 --num-requests 500
```
