# KV Cache & Memory Management

This guide covers KV cache allocation, prefix caching, tiered GPU+CPU offload, and chunked prefill — the memory subsystem that determines how many requests can run concurrently.

```bash
# Quick example: simulate with reduced KV blocks to observe preemptions
./blis run --model qwen/qwen3-14b --hardware H100 --tp 1 \
  --total-kv-blocks 5000 --rate 50 --num-requests 200
```

## Block Allocation Model

KV cache is allocated in **blocks** of `--block-size-in-tokens` tokens (default: 16). Each request consumes `ceil(token_count / block_size)` blocks. Blocks are reference-counted and can be shared across requests via prefix caching.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--total-kv-blocks` | Per-model* | Total GPU-tier KV blocks |
| `--block-size-in-tokens` | 16 | Tokens per block |

*For roofline and trained-physics modes, the block count is auto-calculated from model architecture and GPU memory. Explicit `--total-kv-blocks` always wins. See [Configuration Reference](../reference/configuration.md#resolution-process).

!!! tip "Block size affects prefix cache granularity"
    Prefix caching uses block-aligned hashing (`hash.ComputeBlockHashes`). Smaller block sizes increase cache hit granularity but also increase allocation overhead. Choose block size relative to your typical prefix lengths.

## Prefix Caching

When requests share common prefixes (e.g., system prompts in RAG), BLIS can reuse KV cache blocks from prior computations. This reduces prefill tokens and improves TTFT.

Prefix caching is automatic when using the `weighted` routing policy. The default profile (`precise-prefix-cache:2, queue-depth:1, kv-utilization:1`) queries actual instance KV cache state to route requests to instances with cached prefix blocks:

```bash
./blis run --model qwen/qwen3-14b --hardware H100 --tp 1 \
  --num-instances 4 --routing-policy weighted \
  --prefix-tokens 512 --rate 100 --num-requests 500
```

## Minimum KV Block Requirements

!!! danger "DroppedUnservable rejection"
    Requests are dropped as **unservable** (incrementing `DroppedUnservable`) in two cases:

    1. **MaxModelLen guard** — when `--max-model-len` is set, requests whose total sequence length (input + output budget) exceeds the context window are rejected before entering the queue. This mirrors vLLM's `--max-model-len` validation.
    2. **KV capacity guard** — when `ceil(inputTokens / blockSize) > TotalCapacity()`, the request physically cannot fit in GPU memory. This mirrors vLLM's pre-engine rejection path.

    Both guards fire at enqueue time, before the request enters the wait queue.

!!! info "Proactive MaxModelLen cap"
    When `--max-model-len` is set, a three-part enforcement matches vLLM's scheduler semantics: (1) `FormBatch` proactively clamps token scheduling to `maxModelLen - 1 - ProgressIndex`, (2) `executeBatchStep` skips decode when no tokens are allocated, and (3) `processCompletions` force-completes requests at the `maxModelLen - 1` boundary. Output per length-capped request: `maxModelLen - 1 - inputLen` tokens.

Compute the minimum blocks needed for your workload:

```
min_blocks = ceil(max_input_tokens / block_size)
```

For a workload with max 7,000 input tokens and block size 16: `ceil(7000/16) = 438` blocks minimum. Below this, requests are dropped. Below ~2x this threshold, cascading preemptions cause severe throughput degradation.

## How the auto-calculated pool is sized

A KV block is a **global** quantity, in the same units vLLM reports: one block holds `--block-size-in-tokens` tokens of one sequence, a request is charged `ceil(inputTokens / blockSize)` blocks once, and the pool holds `total_kv_blocks × block_size` tokens in total. On a TP>1 deployment each of the TP ranks stores its own shard of every block (its KV-head slice, or a full replica of the compressed latent for an MLA model), so allocating one block consumes memory on **every** GPU in the group.

`CalculateKVBlocks` therefore divides an aggregate budget by an aggregate per-block cost:

```
blocks = (gpu_mem × util × TP − weights − activation − non_torch × TP − lora_reservation)
         ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                         per_GPU_KV_bytes_per_token × block_size × TP
```

Before #1846 the denominator omitted the `× TP`, dividing a group-total budget by a per-GPU cost and over-estimating the pool by ~TP (measured at 8.7× on a 230B MoE / H200 / TP8 deployment and 10.9× on H100 / TP8). Because the error only bites once a run approaches KV exhaustion, an oversized pool is silent below the knee and then removes the knee entirely — which is usually the headline of a capacity study. TP=1 was and is unaffected.

!!! note "Same units as vLLM, not the same number"
    The formula above reproduces the constants and structure of llm-d-benchmark's `capacity_planner.py`. It is an **analytical estimate**, not a re-derivation of vLLM's own sizing: vLLM *profiles* each rank's free memory after a warm-up forward pass, so it charges the peak torch activation on every GPU, whereas `activation` above is subtracted **once** from a budget aggregated over TP GPUs. The auto-calc therefore under-charges roughly `(TP − 1) × 5.5–8 GiB`. The two agree at TP=1 and diverge with TP, this estimate staying the optimistic one:

    | Deployment (230B MoE, TP=8, fp8 KV) | Engine's measured pool | BLIS auto-calc | Ratio |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | H200, 141 GiB | 480,473 blocks | 521,563 | 1.09× |
    | H100, 80 GiB | 89,552 blocks | 121,793 | 1.36× |

    The H100 residual is larger because the fixed overhead constants are a bigger share of the budget when the weights nearly fill the card — a second-order effect #1846 scoped out. Both rows are pinned as tests in `sim/latency/kv_capacity_tp_basis_test.go`; the activation basis is tracked as issue #1848. Pin `--total-kv-blocks` to the engine's reported `GPU KV cache size ÷ block_size` when you need the pool to match a specific deployment exactly.

## Tiered Caching (GPU + CPU Offload)

BLIS models tiered KV cache with GPU→CPU offloading:

```bash
./blis run --model qwen/qwen3-14b --hardware H100 --tp 1 \
  --kv-cpu-blocks 50000 \
  --kv-offload-threshold 0.9 \
  --rate 100 --num-requests 500
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--kv-cpu-blocks` | 0 | CPU-tier blocks (0 = disabled) |
| `--kv-offload-threshold` | 0.9 | GPU utilization fraction above which blocks offload to CPU |
| `--kv-transfer-bandwidth` | unset ⇒ derive | Override the CPU↔GPU transfer rate, in tokens/tick. Omit it to derive from `cpu_dram`; a supplied value must be finite and > 0 |
| `--kv-transfer-base-latency` | unset ⇒ derive | Override the fixed per-block latency in ticks. Omit it to derive from `cpu_dram`; an explicitly supplied `0` disables the fixed cost |

#### Where the transfer cost comes from (#1819)

The per-block transfer cost on this path is **derived**, not defaulted:

```
ticks per block = ceil(per_block_bytes / effective_bandwidth) + ceil(base_latency)
per_block_bytes = KVBytesPerToken × block_size
```

`bandwidth` and `base_latency` are **catalog** facts for the `cpu_dram` storage device —
`<catalog>/devices/storage.yaml`, the same table `--kv-offload-config`'s `device_class` reads
— with the bandwidth scaled by a dimensionless **efficiency residual** (R2G3b). Catalog base
latency is in microseconds; one simulator tick is one microsecond, and fractional values are
rounded up. Each flag independently overrides its component, including an explicit
`--kv-transfer-base-latency=0`. If either flag is omitted, `cpu_dram` is required; supplying
both overrides avoids reading the device table.

The residual is not an efficiency below 1. It is anchored so the derived rate reproduces the
rate this flag used to default to (100.0) at one named reference deployment
(`qwen/qwen3-14b`, TP=1) — which works out to **≈819×** `cpu_dram`'s rated bandwidth. That
number is the honest record of what the retired bandwidth default asserted, and that bandwidth
term is preserved. The additive catalog base latency is intentionally new: at the reference it
changes a reload from 1 tick to 2 ticks. The committed matrix remains byte-identical because it
does not enable the legacy tier. **If you want a faithful CPU-offload cost, use
`--kv-offload-config`**, whose tiers price the catalog device directly with no residual.
Authoring the residual into `blis-registry` alongside `kv_transfer_base_latency` is tracked in
[blis-registry#17](https://github.com/inference-sim/blis-registry/issues/17).

Away from the reference the derived rate scales as `1 / KVBytesPerToken` — a model with a
quarter the KV per token moves four times the tokens per tick over the same bus, which the
retired constant could not express.

All latency arithmetic is checked. A rate small enough to make the bandwidth charge exceed
`2^52` ticks is refused, as is a base latency that is negative, non-finite, unrepresentable, or
too large to add to the bandwidth charge. `TieredKVCache` repeats the combined check for every
caller and checks cumulative additions, so repeated reloads cannot wrap pending latency
negative. These checks apply to **both** catalog-derived and explicitly supplied values on
`run` and `replay`:

- invalid `cpu_dram` physics is refused with the device and offending field;
- invalid overrides are refused with the relevant flag. Being finite and `> 0` is not
  sufficient for bandwidth: `--kv-transfer-bandwidth 1e-300` would still overflow.

### Multi-Tier Offload Config Surface (`--kv-offload-config`)

The scalar flags above cover the single CPU tier. For vLLM's **multi-tier** offload
(CPU → disk / object store), BLIS captures the full config surface through one strict-YAML
file — `--kv-offload-config <path>` — with a single top-level `kv_offload:` block. This
mirrors `--lora-config` / `--saturation-config`: absent ⇒ the offload subsystem is inert and
output is byte-identical to a build without it.

```bash
./blis run --model qwen/qwen3-14b --hardware H100 --tp 1 --kv-offload-config offload.yaml
```

```yaml
kv_offload:
  cpu_bytes_to_use: 17179869184     # required when the block is present
  block_size: 16                    # optional; default = GPU block size (mutually
                                    #   exclusive with blocks_per_chunk)
  # blocks_per_chunk: 1             # alternate encoding of block_size (default 1)
  eviction_policy: lru              # lru | arc  (default lru)
  offload_prompt_only: true         # vLLM DEFAULT (prompt-only). false => promptAndDecode:
                                    #   full decode blocks are offloaded and reused too (see below)
  # self_describing_kv_events: false
  # tokens_per_hash: 16             # default = GPU block size
  secondary_tiers:
    - type: fs                      # only "fs" is representable today; obj/p2p error loudly
      root_dir: /mnt/kv-cache
      n_read_threads: 16            # vLLM default 16
      n_write_threads: 16           # vLLM default 16
      locality: LOCAL               # LOCAL | REMOTE (optional)
      direct_io: true               # REQUIRED — BLIS makes vLLM's runtime O_DIRECT probe explicit
      device_class: nvme_gen4       # resolves read/write bandwidth + latency from the catalog
      # read_bandwidth: 7000.0      # bytes/µs — overrides device_class (per-direction, required as a pair)
      # write_bandwidth: 5000.0
      # base_latency: 80.0          # µs
```

Defaults match vLLM knob-for-knob. Anything vLLM accepts either maps to a BLIS config or
fails **loudly** at startup — never silently ignored: `store_threshold >= 2` is rejected
(vLLM's `TieringOffloadingSpec` rejects it), and `obj`/`p2p`/`example` tier types are rejected
(no faithful BLIS mapping yet). `device_class` names resolve against the storage-device table
in the **catalog** — `<catalog>/devices/storage.yaml`, a sibling of the catalog's `models/`
namespace, located by the same `--catalog` / `BLIS_CATALOG` that supplies the model config
(#1770; the table used to be duplicated between `defaults.yaml` and the catalog with nothing
keeping the copies in sync, so the catalog is now the single source of truth). An explicit
`read_bandwidth`/`write_bandwidth`/`base_latency` triple overrides the class — a tier that
supplies one needs no catalog device table at all, and the table is read only when some tier
actually names a `device_class`. A named class that the catalog table does not define, or a
missing/malformed table, is a hard error naming the path.

Bandwidths are **bytes per microsecond**, latency in **µs**. Bytes/µs and MB/s (MB = 10⁶ bytes,
not MiB) are the *same number* — 1 MB/s = 10⁶ bytes / 10⁶ µs = 1 byte/µs — so the `blis-catalog`
file's "MB/s" header and BLIS's "bytes/µs" documentation describe identical values with no
conversion between them.

The resolved config is recorded in the exported trace header, so a `blis run --trace-output`
round-trips through `blis replay` (INV-13): on replay the header is authoritative and a config
the binary cannot reproduce fails loudly rather than silently degrading to single-tier.

The `offload_prompt_only` knob is an explicit policy over *what enters the tiers*. Modeling
vLLM's mechanism (`_calc_num_offloadable_tokens` + `storable_chunks`), a request's computed KV is
truncated to the prompt length when `true` (the default), then floor-divided into whole chunks — so
a chunk containing any decode token is never offloaded (a prompt of `1.5 ×` the chunk size offloads
exactly 1 chunk). With `offload_prompt_only: false` (vLLM's `promptAndDecode`), full decode blocks
are offloaded too; because BLIS already hashes every completed block prefix-consistently (for
`block_size > 1`), a later request on the same instance whose **input contains earlier output
tokens** (multi-turn / agentic workloads) reloads that decode KV from the tiers instead of
recomputing it. A reloaded prefix is billed as a **cache hit** — its tokens are dropped from the
prefill forward pass, so it lowers that request's prefill compute and TTFT rather than being
charged as a full recompute (#1699; the same correction applies to the legacy `--kv-cpu-blocks`
tier). Reuse is single-instance (offload tiers are per-instance and invisible to the router).

At `block_size == 1` decode blocks take a guarded allocation path that leaves them unhashed, so
decode-offload is inert there — a degenerate offload block size (real offload block sizes track
the GPU block size). With no `--kv-offload-config`, behavior is unchanged (INV-6).

### Enabling and Disabling Offload

Offload is **off by default**. There is one switch — the presence of `--kv-offload-config`:

```bash
# ENABLED — CPU staging tier
./blis run --model qwen/qwen3-14b --hardware H100 --tp 1 --workload-spec wl_multitenant.yaml \
  --total-kv-blocks 3000 --kv-offload-config offload_cpu.yaml

# DISABLED — omit the flag
./blis run --model qwen/qwen3-14b --hardware H100 --tp 1 --workload-spec wl_multitenant.yaml \
  --total-kv-blocks 3000
```

`--kv-offload-config` is mutually exclusive with the legacy scalar `--kv-cpu-blocks` tier.

### Sizing the CPU Tier

The CPU tier is configured in **bytes**, but the cache uses it in **blocks** — the same unit as
the GPU tier's `--total-kv-blocks`. BLIS converts once, at startup:

```
block_capacity = floor(cpu_bytes_to_use / per_block_bytes)
```

Because both tiers are counted in blocks, they are directly comparable, and that gives the one
sizing rule that matters:

> **`block_capacity` must comfortably exceed `--total-kv-blocks`.** A CPU tier no larger than the
> GPU tier cannot serve anything the GPU evicted, and the run will show no benefit.

`per_block_bytes` is derived from the model, so it differs per deployment. For Qwen3-14B at TP=1
it is **2,621,440 bytes**, which makes the 1 TiB tier used in the example below
`1099511627776 / 2621440` = **419,430 blocks** — well clear of the 3,000 GPU blocks. To check any
config, compare `cpu_bytes_to_use / per_block_bytes` against `--total-kv-blocks` before drawing
conclusions from a run. For the example workload below:

```
shared prefixes  100 × 1024/16 =  6,400 blocks
unique tails     600 × 1280/16 = 48,000 blocks
tier saturates at              = 54,400 blocks
```

!!! note "`cpu_bytes_to_use` is per GPU, not per deployment"
    Under tensor parallelism the KV cache is sharded across ranks, so both sides of that division
    are per-rank quantities. The host memory a deployment actually consumes is `TP × cpu_bytes_to_use`.
    A node-level memory budget must therefore be divided by TP before it goes in the file. This
    matches vLLM, where `cpu_bytes_to_use` is likewise a per-worker budget.

### Example: The Measured Effect of CPU Offload

#### The workload needs prefixes the GPU will evict

Offload only helps if blocks are **evicted** from the GPU and later requested again. Otherwise the
KV cache stays on the GPU and the lower tiers have almost nothing to serve. The fixture below uses
100 distinct per-tenant prefixes so eviction happens without having to starve the GPU:

```yaml
# wl_multitenant.yaml — 100 tenants, each with its own 1,024-token prefix
version: "2"
seed: 42
aggregate_rate: 4.0
num_requests: 600
cohorts:
  - id: tenants
    population: 100
    prefix_group: doc
    prefix_sharing: per_member     # 100 DISTINCT prefixes => GPU must evict
    prefix_length: 1024            # ADDITIVE on input_distribution
    rate_fraction: 1.0
    arrival: {process: poisson}
    input_distribution:  {type: constant, params: {value: 1280}}
    output_distribution: {type: constant, params: {value: 16}}
```

```yaml
# offload_cpu.yaml — one CPU tier, sized well above the GPU tier
kv_offload:
  cpu_bytes_to_use: 1099511627776   # 1 TiB
  block_size: 16
  eviction_policy: lru
  offload_prompt_only: true
```

!!! warning "`prefix_length` is added to `input_distribution`"
    The generator samples `input_distribution` first, then prepends the prefix tokens to that slice:

    ```go
    // sim/workload/generator.go
    inputTokens = append(append([]sim.TokenID{}, prefix...), inputTokens...)
    ```

    The prefix is therefore extra tokens on top of the sampled length, not a shared portion carved
    out of it: `input_distribution: 1280` with `prefix_length: 1024` means 1,024 prefix tokens are
    added to 1,280 **unique** tokens per request — a **2,304**-token prompt in total.

    Separately, `--workload-spec` supersedes `--prefix-tokens` / `--rate` on the command line, so
    the arrival rate comes from the spec's `aggregate_rate: 4.0`.

#### Results

Run the enabled and disabled commands from the previous section. `Cache Hit Rate` is printed to
stdout under `=== KV Cache Metrics ===`; add `--metrics-path m.json` for the full-precision
`cache_hit_rate` field.

| | `cache_hit_rate` | `ttft_mean_ms` | `e2e_mean_ms` | `responses_per_sec` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Offload **disabled** | 0.0772 | 52.550 | 250.303 | 4.1640 |
| Offload **enabled** (1 TiB CPU tier) | **0.3678** | **40.605** | **235.619** | 4.1645 |

Cache hit rate rises **4.8×** and mean TTFT falls **22.7%** (−11.9 ms). Throughput is unchanged
because this workload is arrival-bound — 4 req/s offered against an unsaturated instance. Offload
buys latency here; it buys *throughput* only under saturation, where spending fewer prefill tokens
per request lets more requests into each step.

Why the hit rate lands near 0.37: only the 1,024-token prefix is shareable and each tenant's first
request must miss, so a little over a third is the ceiling. The enabled run reaches 0.3678 —
essentially every reuse the workload contains, and the same hit rate an unconstrained GPU cache
achieves on this workload.

## Chunked Prefill

Long prefill sequences can cause **head-of-line (HOL) blocking** — a 2,048-token prefill takes ~97ms on Qwen3-14B / H100 / TP=1 (roofline mode), blocking shorter requests from starting.

Chunked prefill splits long prefills into smaller chunks:

```bash
./blis run --model qwen/qwen3-14b --hardware H100 --tp 1 \
  --long-prefill-token-threshold 256 \
  --rate 100 --num-requests 500
```

!!! info "Chunked prefill benefits TTFT, not ITL"
    With `--long-prefill-token-threshold=256`, short-request TTFT p99 improves by ~52% in bimodal workloads. But ITL is unaffected (<0.5%) because ~255 of ~256 ITL samples per request are decode-only steps. The benefit is in scheduling new requests, not in token generation speed.

## Batch Formation Parameters

KV cache pressure is directly coupled to batch formation:

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--max-num-seqs` | 256 | Maximum requests in the running batch (vLLM parity; deprecated alias `--max-num-running-reqs`) |
| `--max-num-batched-tokens` | 2048 | Token budget per step (vLLM parity; deprecated alias `--max-num-scheduled-tokens`) |

These are the primary capacity knobs — in vLLM terms, `max_num_seqs` and `max_num_batched_tokens`. Reducing them decreases KV cache pressure but also reduces throughput.

## Identifying the KV Pressure Cliff

Preemption rates spike non-linearly as KV blocks decrease past a threshold. The threshold depends on your workload's **median** token count (not mean or tail):

```bash
# Sweep KV blocks to find the cliff
for blocks in 100000 50000 20000 10000 5000 3000; do
  echo "=== blocks=$blocks ==="
  ./blis run --model qwen/qwen3-14b --hardware H100 --tp 1 \
    --total-kv-blocks $blocks --rate 50 --num-requests 200 2>/dev/null \
    | grep -E "preemption_count|completed_requests"
done
```

!!! tip "Distribution median drives KV pressure"
    ParetoLogNormal distributions produce *fewer* preemptions than Gaussian despite similar means, because the Pareto component's median (~79 tokens) is much lower than Gaussian's median (~256 tokens). Short requests cycle faster, creating "breathing room" in the KV cache.
