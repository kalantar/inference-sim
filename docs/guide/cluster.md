# Cluster Simulation

This guide covers running multi-instance BLIS simulations — the full pipeline from request arrival through admission, routing, scheduling, and metrics aggregation.

```bash
# Quick example: 4-instance cluster with tracing
./blis run --model qwen/qwen3-14b --hardware H100 --tp 1 \
  --num-instances 4 --rate 100 --num-requests 500 \
  --trace-level decisions --summarize-trace
```

## Single-Instance vs Cluster Mode

| Setting | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `--num-instances 1` (default) | Single-instance: requests go directly to the wait queue, no admission or routing |
| `--num-instances N` (N > 1) | Cluster mode: requests pass through admission → routing → per-instance queues |

## The Pipeline

```
Request → Admission → Routing → Instance WaitQueue → Batch Formation → Step → Completion
                                                          ↓
                                                    KV Allocation + Latency Estimation
```

Each stage is configurable:

| Stage | Controls | Key Flags |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Admission** | Whether to accept the request | `--admission-policy`, `--token-bucket-capacity` |
| **Routing** | Which instance receives it | `--routing-policy`, `--routing-scorers` |
| **Scheduling** | What order within the instance | `--scheduler`, `--priority-policy` |
| **Batch Formation** | Which requests form the next batch | `--max-num-seqs`, `--max-num-batched-tokens` |

## Tensor Parallelism

The `--tp` flag sets the tensor parallelism degree for all instances. TP affects both latency (FLOPs split across the TP ranks) and memory (each rank contributes its GPU's memory to one shared budget):

```bash
# TP=2: 2 GPUs per instance
./blis run --model qwen/qwen3-14b --hardware H100 \
  --num-instances 4 --tp 2 --rate 100 --num-requests 500

# TP=4: 4 GPUs per instance (lower latency, and usually a larger total KV pool)
./blis run --model qwen/qwen3-14b --hardware H100 \
  --num-instances 2 --tp 4 --rate 100 --num-requests 500
```

`total_kv_blocks` is a **global** count for the instance, not a per-GPU one: every TP rank stores its own shard of each block, so raising `--tp` does not split a fixed pool into smaller per-GPU pieces. It usually *increases* the pool, because each added GPU brings a whole GPU of memory while the model weights stay one fixed total shared across the ranks. See [KV Cache Management](kv-cache.md#how-the-auto-calculated-pool-is-sized) for the formula and its accuracy limits.

!!! note "Homogeneous instances"
    All instances share the same SimConfig (model, GPU, TP, KV blocks). BLIS does not currently model heterogeneous fleets (mixed GPU types or TP configurations).

### Multi-node tensor parallelism

When node pools are configured (`--policy-config` with `node_pools`), an instance whose `--tp` exceeds a pool's `gpus_per_node` can occupy **whole nodes across the same pool** — enabling multi-node TP for models too large for a single node (e.g. TP=16 on 2×8 H100). This happens automatically and only as a fallback: BLIS first tries to fit the instance on a single node in any matching pool, and spans nodes only when no single node can host the full TP group.

Multi-node TP is modeled as **whole-node occupancy**: it engages only when `tp` is a whole multiple of `gpus_per_node` (e.g. `tp=16` on 8-GPU nodes → 2 nodes), and the instance takes complete nodes so every node carries an equal TP rank count. This is the shape vLLM's multiprocessing (`mp`) executor enforces (it asserts `world_size % nnodes == 0` and derives an equal per-node rank count); vLLM's Ray backend tolerates an asymmetric spread but warns against it, so BLIS is deliberately stricter than the most permissive backend. (vLLM's docs actually recommend avoiding multi-node TP altogether in favor of TP-within-node + PP-across-nodes — see the interconnect note below.) If `tp ≤ gpus_per_node` but the pool is merely fragmented (no single node momentarily has room), the instance is **not** spanned (the resulting asymmetric rank split is discouraged and not modeled); it stays pending, exactly as before. Single-node placement is unchanged.

A spanning instance is billed for every node it occupies (`cost_per_hour × nodes_spanned`).

!!! note "Configuration constraints"
    Two node-pool configurations are rejected at startup (with a clear panic) because they would otherwise produce silently-wrong span/cost numbers — both tracked for proper support by [#1543](https://github.com/inference-sim/inference-sim/issues/1543):

    - A per-role tensor-parallel override (`--prefill-tp` / `--decode-tp`) that **differs from the global `--tp`** is not supported with `node_pools`: placement, node-span, and cost all use the global `--tp`, so a differing per-role TP would be simulated at one degree but placed and billed at another. Use a uniform `--tp`.
    - Every pool must have a **distinct `gpu_type`**: cost (`cost_per_hour`) and capacity (`gpu_memory_gib`) are resolved by first-match on `gpu_type`, so two pools sharing a type would resolve ambiguously.

!!! warning "Cross-node interconnect: bandwidth priced, per-hop latency not calibrated"
    Cross-node collective traffic **is** priced ([#1530](https://github.com/inference-sim/inference-sim/issues/1530)): when a collective's group does not fit inside one node, the trained-physics communication terms charge it at a blended intra/inter-node bandwidth derived from the actual placement. Two things gate it. The `--latency-model` must be `trained-physics` (roofline models no communication at all — [#1663](https://github.com/inference-sim/inference-sim/issues/1663)), and the placed GPU's entry in `--hardware-config` must declare `IntraNodeBwGBps` / `InterNodeBwGBps`; BLIS warns once, on first span, when either is missing, so an unpriced span is never silent. Expect roughly +10% on step time for TP=16 on 2×8 H100 — modest because NCCL's hierarchical all-reduce sends only the reduced chunk across the fabric. What is still **optimistic** is the fixed launch and round-trip cost of each cross-node hop: it *is* modeled as an analytic `n_steps · α_hop · S` term (`InterNodeHopLatencyUs`, [#1694](https://github.com/inference-sim/inference-sim/issues/1694) — `n_steps` is the hop count of the placed span, node-span-aware), but `α_hop` ships **uncalibrated at 0**, so nothing is charged for it out of the box — and at decode message sizes it is plausibly the larger of the two effects. Supplying a measured `α_hop` from an NCCL microbenchmark is [#1694](https://github.com/inference-sim/inference-sim/issues/1694). The eager/no-overlap serialization multiplier `S` (`--comm-serialization-factor`, default 1.0; `--enforce-eager` requires an explicit `S > 1`) scales that term for deployments that run without CUDA graphs. Note also that cross-node TP is itself the aggressive topology: vLLM recommends **pipeline parallelism across nodes and tensor parallelism within a node**, precisely because per-layer TP all-reduce means many small collectives over inter-node links (InfiniBand/Ethernet, roughly an order of magnitude below NVLink). Multi-node placement is `blis run` only: `blis replay` rejects `node_pools` outright, and `blis observe` cannot express them at all (it has no `--policy-config` and builds no simulator — its timing comes from a real server). Pipeline parallelism is not yet modeled (tracked by [#1535](https://github.com/inference-sim/inference-sim/issues/1535)).

## Scaling and Saturation

Instance scaling produces **super-linear** TTFT improvement near saturation. With the default model (Qwen3-14B / H100 / TP=1, ~17 req/s per instance at saturation), scaling from 4→12 instances at rate=200 improves TTFT p99 from ~1,500ms to ~54ms.

This happens because the per-instance queue growth rate `excess = λ/k - μ` drops faster than linearly:

```
4 instances:  excess = 200/4 - 17  = 33 req/s per instance   → rapid queue growth
8 instances:  excess = 200/8 - 17  = 8 req/s per instance    → near saturation
12 instances: excess = 200/12 - 17 = -0.3 req/s per instance → balanced (sub-saturation)
```

At sub-saturation (excess ≤ 0): TTFT converges to the baseline (~54ms) and further scaling provides diminishing returns.

## Admission Control

For rate-limiting and traffic shaping policies, see the [Admission Control](admission.md) page.

## Admission and Routing Latency

Model real network/processing overhead between gateway and backend:

```bash
--admission-latency 1000   # 1ms admission decision overhead
--routing-latency 500      # 0.5ms routing decision overhead
```

These add simulated delays to the admission and routing pipeline, modeling gRPC overhead, service mesh hops, and queue serialization in production deployments.

## Decision Tracing

Log every routing decision for offline analysis:

```bash
./blis run --model qwen/qwen3-14b --hardware H100 --tp 1 \
  --num-instances 4 --rate 100 --num-requests 500 \
  --trace-level decisions --summarize-trace --counterfactual-k 3
```

The trace summary shows:
- **Target Distribution** — how many requests went to each instance
- **Mean/Max Regret** — how much better an alternative routing decision could have been

!!! info "Counterfactual regret for weighted policies"
    For score-based policies (weighted, least-loaded), counterfactual regret is **structurally zero** — the chosen instance is always the highest-scoring one. Regret is only meaningful for non-score-based policies like round-robin.

## Event Ordering

The cluster uses `(timestamp, priority, seqID)` ordering for deterministic event processing:

- Cluster events at time T process before instance events at time T
- Same-time instance ties broken by lowest instance index
- This ensures determinism (INV-6) but means results differ from a simple M/M/k queueing model

## Work-Conserving Property

BLIS is work-conserving (INV-8): it never idles while requests wait. After every step completion, if the WaitQ has requests, a new StepEvent is immediately scheduled. Real systems may have scheduling delays not modeled here.
