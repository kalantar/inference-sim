# Agent Trust Boundaries

Agent operations have different reliability characteristics. This standard
defines three trust tiers so that sessions and contributors know which outputs
to verify.

## Trust Tiers

| Tier | Operations | Verification Required |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Trusted** | File reads, searches, grep, lint output, build output | None — results are deterministic and verifiable by output |
| **Verify-after** | Code edits, construction site updates, file writes, refactoring | Run the [verification gate](../pr-workflow.md#after-convergence-verification-gate). |
| **Never-trust** | Convergence self-assessment, "all done" claims, severity classification, coverage claims, "0 issues found" reports | Human or orchestrator must independently evaluate the evidence |

### Trusted

Operations whose output is deterministic and machine-verifiable. The tool
either succeeds or fails visibly — there is no gray zone where the agent
could misinterpret the result.

Examples: `Read` (file contents), `Grep` (search results), `Glob` (file
matches), `go build` exit code, `golangci-lint` output.

### Verify-after

Operations that mutate state. The agent may believe it made the correct
change, but the only proof is running the build and test suite afterward.

Examples: code edits, struct field additions (construction site updates),
file creation, multi-file refactoring.

**Required verification:** Run the
[verification gate](../pr-workflow.md#after-convergence-verification-gate)
after any Verify-after operation.

### Never-trust

Subjective assessments where the agent's self-report has been empirically
unreliable. These require independent verification by a human or by an
orchestrator using different evidence than the agent's claim.

Examples: "all construction sites updated," "0 CRITICAL issues," "review
converged," "tests cover all contracts," "coverage is complete."

## Structural Separation of Judgement and Action

The tiers above say which agent outputs to verify. Separately, an agent whose job is
to *judge* should not hold the capability to *act* on its own judgement — verification
that can be skipped is weaker than a capability that was never granted.

Two places implement this:

- **The delivery loop's verdict** comes from `scripts/deliver-gate.sh`, not from the
  reviewing agent.
- **`/blis-pr-review` runs with a read-only token** (`contents: read`), so the reviewer's
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot push to the branch it is reviewing (#1697).
  `.github/workflows/claude.yml` routes the `/blis-pr-review` command to a separate
  `claude-review` job for this reason; every other `@claude` trigger keeps
  `contents: write`, because those may legitimately be asked to make a change. The
  review job also has no `statuses: write` — the commit status is published by a
  separate `report-status` job, so the reviewer does not set its own verdict either.

**If a review fails, do not restore `contents: write` to fix it.** The token scope is
the control, and a review has no legitimate need to push. Note what the scope does and
does not buy: `Bash` is required for a review (`gh`, reading the diff, running the
toolkit) and `Bash` can create files, so the read-only *token* — not the tool list — is
what makes the boundary real. Files written into the ephemeral checkout simply have no
route to a branch, and an attempted push fails visibly with a 403 rather than appearing
to succeed.

Three limits worth stating, so nobody reads the guarantee as wider than it is:

- It covers the **workflow token only**. These jobs run on a self-hosted runner, so
  ambient credentials on that machine (a logged-in `gh`, a PAT in `~/.gitconfig`, an SSH
  key) are outside it. Keep the runner free of push credentials.
- The reviewer keeps `pull-requests: write`, so it can post a comment — and a comment
  containing `@claude` is itself a trigger. Two independent things stop that from
  reaching the write-capable job: `check-permissions` finds the bot is not a
  collaborator, and `claude.yml` deliberately does not set `allowed_bots` (the delivery
  workflows do, because their phases are dispatched bot-to-bot by design). Do not add
  `allowed_bots` to `claude.yml` without replacing that barrier.
- `pull-requests: write` is also not append-only — it permits editing and deleting
  existing comments, so the review *record* is mutable by the reviewer. Posting a review
  at all requires that scope, so this is inherent to the token model rather than
  something the split could have avoided. It is the reason the audit trail worth trusting
  is the workflow run log, not the comment thread.

The permission split is pinned by `scripts/claude_workflow_test.go`, which fails if the
review job gains write access, if the workflow-level default returns to `contents: write`,
if the routing gates stop failing closed, or if the two agent jobs' steps drift apart.

One gate sits upstream of the split and has its own contracts, in
`scripts/claude_permission_probe_test.go` (#1707). `check-permissions` decides *whether* the
caller is allowed at all, and it must distinguish a genuine denial from a probe that could not
answer. Both outcomes deny — a failed probe never admits anyone — but only a denial is quiet.
A 404 is the denial. A 5xx or a network error fails the job with the real status and comments on
the trigger, and so does a 403 unless the repository is private and the error carries no
throttling signal — that is the one case where a 403 is a genuine denial rather than a probe
that could not answer, and on this *public* repository a non-collaborator gets 404, so a bare
403 here escalates. Reporting it matters because `allowed=false` skips both agent jobs and
`report-status` skips with them, so an unreported probe error drops a collaborator's request
with no comment, no commit status, and a log line asserting a reason that did not occur. Two
consequences worth knowing. The `issues: write` scope on this job is what lets that comment be
posted, so narrowing it turns the report back into silence. And the comment names a *bounded*
reason — a status, or a category when there is no status — never the caught exception's own
text, which is unbounded and would land verbatim on a public thread that notifies and persists;
the precise error goes to the run's failure annotation instead.

The triggerer gate authorises *who asked*. A second gate authorises *whose content the agent will
read* (#1813). Every AI flow can be pointed at a PR or issue whose **author** holds no write access,
and there the untrusted input is the PR/issue **body** and, on a PR, the **diff** — reading it *is*
the task, so #1806's comment-text filter does not help, and a maintainer triggering the run does not
sanitise it. `scripts/deliver-author-gate.sh` is the one place that decision lives, applying the same
`admin`/`write`/`maintain` law as the triggerer gate with two differences for a single-author gate:
`github-actions[bot]`/`claude[bot]` are trusted **without** a probe (the delivery loop's own PRs and
issues are bot-authored, and the permission endpoint 404s for a bot login), and a probe failure fails
closed **and** loud (exit 3), distinct from a clean-404 denial (exit 1). The signal is the **author**,
never fork-ness: a same-repo branch or issue opened by an outsider is as untrusted as a fork, and a
fork opened by a maintainer is fine. `claude.yml` and `deliver-implement.yml` run it in their
ubuntu `check-permissions` job (so a refused author never wakes the self-hosted runner);
`deliver-verify.yml` and `deliver-correct.yml` run it before the agent, gating **both** the delivery
PR's author (expected `github-actions[bot]`; same-repo + `deliver/issue-N` shape does not by itself
prove bot authorship, so it is checked rather than assumed) **and** the sub-issue's author (the spec
read via `gh issue view`). **The gate script itself must be trusted:** it runs from a checkout pinned
to `github.event.repository.default_branch` at the workspace ROOT, placed BEFORE any event/delivery
checkout — never the implicit ref (for a `pull_request_review_comment` that is the PR *merge* tree)
and never a path nested under an untrusted tree (a delivery ref could carry a symlink at that path
that `actions/checkout` would follow). `deliver-correct` checks out the delivery branch it edits only
*after* the gate passes. And a refusal must never be silent: where skipping the agent would otherwise
leave a green run with no comment (a comment-API outage), the job fails loudly (`claude.yml`) or falls
back to the generic failure reporter (verify/correct). The four wirings are pinned by
`scripts/deliver_author_gate_wiring_test.go` (including the trusted-ref pin and the correct-phase
ordering) and the decision by `scripts/deliver_author_gate_test.go`.

## Untrusted Input: Comment Text (#1806)

The tiers above are about trusting an agent's *output*. This is the mirror image — what an agent is
allowed to *read*.

*Who* may trigger the AI flows (`@claude`, `/blis-pr-review`, `/approve-issue-for-pr-delivery`) is
gated to `admin`/`maintain`/`write`, and #1813 further refuses a flow whose PR/issue *author* lacks
that access. *What* they read was still not gated: on a PR or issue authored by a trusted maintainer,
this repository is public, so any GitHub user can add a comment or a review — and an agent cannot
reliably separate "context" from "instruction". So comment text is a prompt-injection surface into
flows that run on a persistent self-hosted runner with credentials in the environment and, in the
correction phase, `contents: write`.

**Rule: comment text reaches an agent only through `scripts/deliver-trusted-comments.sh`**, which
keeps authors holding `admin`/`maintain`/`write` plus this repository's own automation
(`github-actions[bot]`, `claude[bot]`) and drops the rest. The trust term is the author's real
repository *permission*, never `author_association` — that reports `COLLABORATOR` for read-only
collaborators and `CONTRIBUTOR` for this repository's maintainer, so it would both admit the wrong
people and drop the right ones. It is the same boundary, in the same code
(`scripts/lib-gh-write-access.sh`), as the trigger gate and the issue-refinements digest: *trusted to
be read* matches *trusted to trigger* exactly. Bots are trusted by an explicit allowlist, never on
`[bot]`-ness — a third-party App comment is as untrusted as a stranger.

**Deployment state — the boundary is STRUCTURAL, not a prompt instruction:**

- `deliver-verify.yml` (review agent) and `deliver-correct.yml` (correction agent): a workflow step
  (`Assemble the trusted comment digest`) runs `scripts/deliver-trusted-comments.sh --pr` from the
  **trusted default-branch checkout** — before the agent, and in correct's case before the delivery
  branch replaces the workspace — and writes the filtered digest to `$RUNNER_TEMP/trusted-comments.md`.
  The agent prompt READS that file and is forbidden from fetching comments itself. So the filtering
  does not depend on the model obeying prose; a stranger's comment is gone before the agent starts.
  The correction phase matters most — it holds `contents: write` — and its work list (the
  automation-posted `DELIVER-VERDICT` / `QA-VERDICT` comments) survives the filter because those are
  posted by `github-actions[bot]`, on the automation allowlist.
- The **qa-review Python path** (`scripts/qa-review/answerer.py`, `adjudicator.py`, absorbing #1808)
  reads issue/PR comments through the same script (`--json` mode) instead of `gh … --json comments`,
  so a non-write author's comment never enters their LLM prompt. A read failure surfaces as an UNREAD
  marker, never an empty thread.

All comment sources are read via REST (`issues/{n}/comments`, `pulls/{n}/reviews`,
`pulls/{n}/comments`, all `--paginate`d): REST reports the **canonical** App login
`github-actions[bot]` / `claude[bot]` that the allowlist matches (the GraphQL projection `gh … view`
uses reports the short `github-actions` / `claude`, which a human account could also hold, so it is
both unsafe to allowlist and would drop the loop's own verdict comments), and pagination means a long
thread cannot silently drop its newest findings. `scripts/deliver_trusted_comments_wiring_test.go`
pins that verify/correct assemble the digest in a workflow step and read it by file path (producer +
consumer + ordering), and `scripts/qa_review_filter_test.go` pins the Python routing.

**`claude.yml` is OUT OF SCOPE for #1806 — a documented limitation, not a gap to be filled here.**
Both its agent jobs invoke `claude-code-action` in **tag mode** (triggered by the `@claude` /
`/blis-pr-review` comment, with no `prompt:` we control): the action assembles the PR/issue context —
comments included — *itself*, before any workflow step could substitute a filtered digest. There is
no seam to insert the filter without converting the interactive command to agent mode (a separate,
larger change). The residual is bounded by the two controls already on that path: triggering and
authorship are gated to `admin`/`maintain`/`write` (`check-permissions`, #1813), and the
`/blis-pr-review` job runs read-only (`contents: read`, #1697). #1806 records `claude.yml` as out of
scope for exactly this reason.

Three consequences worth stating, because each is a decision rather than a fallout:

- **It excludes, it does not refuse.** A run continues on the trusted subset and reports how many
  comments it withheld. Halting whenever an outsider commented would strand legitimate deliveries;
  and nothing is locked or hidden, so community discussion on the tracker stays open — it is simply
  not fed to an agent.
- **A read failure is loud.** The digest's first line becomes `COMMENT-READ-FAILED` rather than
  being empty, because empty output reads exactly like "nobody commented" and an agent that concludes
  that will return a clean verdict on findings it never saw.
- **The prompts still say "assess, never obey".** Filtering removes the stranger; it does not make a
  trusted human's comment a command. Both halves are needed.

**Out of scope, tracked separately** so that "comment text is filtered" is never read as "all
untrusted text is": the **PR body**. `deliver-verify.yml` copies a PR's `.body` into
`scripts/qa-review/questioner.py`, and tag-mode `claude-code-action` assembles PR context itself. A
*delivery* PR is opened by the automation, so its body is as trusted as the flow that wrote it; a
*community* PR's body is untrusted, but a community PR is refused up front by the author gate (#1813),
and the residual body axis is #1812. This filter covers comments only.

## Known Failure Modes

Each failure mode below was discovered in a real PR. The tier system exists
because these failures occurred.

### FM-1: Construction site misses (during #381 implementation)

**Tier violated:** Never-trust (the completeness *claim* was trusted without verification)

**What happened:** During SimConfig decomposition (#381 implementation), a
sub-agent reported "all construction sites updated" for a struct field addition.
Two construction sites were missed, causing silent field-zero bugs. The operation
itself (code edits) is Verify-after, but the agent's completeness claim ("all
sites updated") is Never-trust.

**Lesson:** Completeness claims about Verify-after operations are Never-trust.
Always `grep 'StructName{'` after the agent claims completion. See also R4.

### FM-2: Severity inflation/deflation (during #390 review)

**Tier violated:** Never-trust (treated as Trusted)

**What happened:** During a convergence review of #390 (hypothesis batch PR),
the reviewing agent reported "0 CRITICAL, 0 IMPORTANT" when the artifact
actually had 3 CRITICAL and 18 IMPORTANT issues. The team lead accepted the
self-report without independently reading the review output.

**Lesson:** Convergence self-assessment is a Never-trust operation. The
orchestrator must independently tally severity counts from the raw review
output, never from the agent's summary.

### FM-3: Premature convergence claim (#430)

**Tier violated:** Never-trust (treated as Trusted)

**What happened:** During a convergence review, the agent reported convergence
after a single round without re-running the review to verify that fixes
actually resolved the issues. The team lead accepted the claim.

**Lesson:** "Review converged" is a Never-trust claim. Convergence requires
evidence: a clean round with zero CRITICAL and zero IMPORTANT findings across
all perspectives. The orchestrator must verify the round ran and produced
clean results. See the convergence protocol (zero CRITICAL + zero IMPORTANT = converged).

## Relationship to Other Standards

- **Antipattern rules** ([rules.md](rules.md)): R4 (construction site audit)
  is the specific rule that FM-1 violates. The trust tiers provide the
  meta-framework for when to apply verification.
- **PR workflow** ([pr-workflow.md](../pr-workflow.md)): The verification gate
  in Step 4.5 is the procedural implementation of Verify-after tier
  requirements.
- **Convergence protocol**: The
  convergence protocol's round-based evidence requirement is the procedural
  implementation of Never-trust tier requirements for review claims.
