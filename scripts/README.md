# scripts/

Reproducible analysis scripts for BLIS. Each script runs `blis` end-to-end and
emits a single CSV summary alongside per-run raw outputs, so anyone can
re-validate a published claim without manually reconstructing the command set.

## archon-review.sh — `/archon-pr-review` review step

Runs `archon-go pr-review` and composes the PR comment. Called by
`.github/workflows/archon.yml`; it lives here rather than inline in the workflow so its
behaviour can be tested (`scripts/archon_review_test.go` drives it against a stub
`archon-go` and throwaway git repositories).

```bash
ARCHON_BIN=... BASE_SHA=... HEAD_SHA=... DECL_FILE=... OUTPUT_FILE=... RUN_URL=... \
  scripts/archon-review.sh
```

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ARCHON_BIN` | archon-go binary, from `archon-build.sh` |
| `BASE_SHA` | the PR's base branch tip (where the plan is looked for first) |
| `HEAD_SHA` | the PR's head commit, already fetched into the object store |
| `DECL_FILE` | file holding plan-declaration candidate text (PR body, then closing-issue bodies) |
| `OUTPUT_FILE` | where the comment body is written; truncated up front |
| `RUN_URL` | workflow run URL, used in the truncation notice |
| `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` | optional; the untruncated body is appended when set |

Exits 0 for every reviewed outcome, including archon failure, so the caller always has a
body to post. Exit 2 only on a usage or environment error. Adds `--plan` to the single
`archon-go` invocation when a plan resolves; retries once without it if that invocation
fails, so a bad plan file never costs the three views.

## deliver-gate.sh — the L1 delivery loop's decision

Decides what happens next in a delivery round: label the PR ready, run another correction, or
stop for a human. Called by `.github/workflows/deliver-verify.yml`; it lives here rather than
inline in the workflow because it is the one place in the loop where a bug could mark broken
code ready to merge, so it is the one place that needs tests
(`scripts/deliver_gate_test.go`). See
[docs/contributing/automated-delivery.md](../docs/contributing/automated-delivery.md).

```bash
CI_STATUS=success PLAN_GATE=pass AGENT_VERDICT=GREEN ROUND=0 MAX_ROUNDS=3 \
  scripts/deliver-gate.sh
# decision=ready
# reason=CI passed, plan signal 'pass', and the review returned GREEN
```

| Variable | Domain | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `CI_STATUS` | `success` \| `failure` \| `unknown` | verify runs `go build`, `go test` and `golangci-lint` against the PR tree; anything but all three passing is `failure`, and an unread signal is `unknown` |
| `PLAN_GATE` | `pass` \| `regression` \| `conflicts` \| `unverified` \| `absent` | from `.archon/review.json`; `absent` (no plan claimed) delivers exactly as `pass`, while `unverified` (a plan declared but never checked) blocks — `archon-review.sh` exits 0 after falling back to a plan-less review, so the two must not be conflated |
| `AGENT_VERDICT` | `GREEN` \| `NOT-GREEN` \| `MISSING` | the review comment's `DELIVER-VERDICT:` marker |
| `QA_VERDICT` | `PASS` \| `BLOCK` \| `MISSING` | the cross-vendor qa-review comment's `QA-VERDICT:` marker (#1715). `MISSING` blocks — a crashed qa-review is missing evidence, never a pass |
| `DISMISSALS` | `none` \| `open` \| `unknown` | from the `deliver:has-dismissals` label. `open` withholds `ready` — a correction dismissed a finding the review has not accepted; `unknown` (unreadable) is treated the same way |
| `MERGE_STATE` | `mergeable` \| `conflicting` \| `unknown` | GitHub's `mergeable_state` mapped through `map-merge-state.sh` (#1758). `conflicting` can never be `ready`; `unknown` returns the non-terminal `recheck` |
| `REVIEWS_SKIPPED` | `true` \| `false` | whether verify skipped both agent reviews this round on a `conflicting` pre-review hint (#1781 G1). When `true` and the branch turns out **not** conflicting, the gate returns the non-terminal `recheck` (re-verify) instead of deciding a round whose reviews never ran — so a stale hint can never dead-end at the round cap |
| `CONFLICT_FILES` | *(optional)* paths | **newline-delimited** paths that conflict with main, from `conflicting-files.sh` (#1781). Newline is the only delimiter, because a git path may legally contain spaces or commas (#1781 G4). Named in the reason so a stop satisfies #1758's "needs-human **naming the conflict**". Read only when `MERGE_STATE` is `conflicting`; absent is fine |
| `ROUND` | integer | correction rounds already spent, read from the `deliver:round-N` label |
| `MAX_ROUNDS` | integer | cap before stopping for a human |

Prints `decision=ready|correct|needs-human|recheck` and a one-line `reason`, exiting 0. Exit 2 only on a
wiring error — an unset input or a non-integer counter — so a misconfigured workflow fails
loudly instead of receiving a verdict. A value outside a declared domain is different: it takes
a catch-all and returns `needs-human`, because GitHub has eight check conclusions rather than
two and an unmapped one must not fall through with no decision at all.

`ready` requires the checks passing, a non-regressing (or absent) plan signal, **and** an explicit GREEN. A GREEN that contradicts an objective signal returns `needs-human` naming the
disagreement — never `ready`, at any round.

A **conflicting** branch is named on every decision row, not just the one row that mentions it
(#1781). The clause is composed once and prepended at the script's single exit point, and a
conflict **outranks an unreadable review marker**: a branch with no merge ref cannot produce a
verdict, so the round routes to `correct` while rounds remain and, at the cap, to a `needs-human`
that names the conflict — rather than to "the verify phase posted no DELIVER-VERDICT marker", which
is what dead-ended PR #1778.

## conflicting-files.sh — which paths conflict with main

Names the paths that conflict when one committish is merged into another, so a stopped delivery can
say WHAT conflicts. Trial-merges in a throwaway worktree, so the caller's index, working tree and
HEAD are untouched; reads conflicted paths from the index (`git ls-files -u`), so delete/modify and
add/add conflicts are named too. Works on git 2.34 (the runners), where `merge-tree --write-tree` is
unavailable. Tested by `scripts/conflicting_files_test.go`.

```bash
scripts/conflicting-files.sh origin/main "$HEAD_SHA"
# CLAUDE.md
```

Exit 0 = determined (**no output means the merge is clean**); exit 3 = could not determine, so a
caller must not read the absence of output as "clean". Best-effort by contract: it is a diagnostic,
never the authority on whether a branch conflicts, and it never fails its caller.

## deliver-update-branch.sh — bring a delivery branch up to date with main

Fetches `origin/main`, merges it, and pushes when the merge is clean; on conflict it aborts and
names the conflicting paths for the correction agent to resolve. Prints
`state=merged|current|conflicting|unknown` plus `files=`, teed into `GITHUB_OUTPUT` by
`.github/workflows/deliver-correct.yml`. Tested by `scripts/deliver_branch_update_test.go` against
real repositories with a real remote.

Because that output is teed into `GITHUB_OUTPUT`, **stdout is the payload channel, not a log**: on
every path it carries only the `state=` line and the `files<<…` heredoc, and all human and git text
— including any git subcommand's, and anything a git hook writes — goes to stderr. `git merge`
writing `Already up to date.` to stdout was enough to fail the step and end a correction round at
`needs-human` before any finding was read (#1799), so the test file asserts the grammar per path.
Every git invocation run for its exit status carries an explicit `>&2` for that reason, with no
exception — not only the ones that print text of their own, since a hook inherits the subcommand's
stdout and git does not redirect `pre-push`. That includes the two `git diff --quiet` worktree
guards, which have no demonstrable leak (`--quiet` suppresses external diff helpers) and are
redirected for uniformity, so the rule stays categorical instead of needing a per-call exemption
list. The remaining git calls are captured in `$(...)` or silenced outright. Add new output to
stderr.

It is a script because on PR #1778 this was a **prompt instruction** to the correction agent, the
round completed `success` with no commit and no comment, and a human had to merge `main` by hand
(#1781). Ordinary drift is the majority of rounds and needs no judgment, so it must not depend on
anything an agent chooses to do; only a real content conflict reaches the agent.

## deliver-conflict-check.sh — did the correction round resolve the conflict?

Fetches both ends into their remote-tracking refs — the agent pushes from inside
claude-code-action, so the workflow's own checkout has not seen the branch tip — and reports
`state=clean|conflicting|unknown` plus `files=`. On `conflicting` the caller posts a comment naming
those files, applies `needs-human`, and withholds the hand-back. It escalates **only on positive
evidence**: `unknown` hands the decision to the phase that reads GitHub's `mergeable_state`, so a
transient fetch failure cannot stop a healthy delivery. Same test file as above.

## deliver-stall-candidates.jq — which deliveries a stall sweep may flag

Reads a `gh pr list --state open --json number,headRefName,labels,createdAt` array on stdin and
emits one `<number>\t<createdAt>` line per delivery that is genuinely in flight: on a
`deliver/issue-<N>` branch, carrying neither terminal label, and not paused. Called by
`.github/workflows/deliver-stall-sweep.yml` via `jq -f`.

It lives here rather than inline in the workflow for the same reason `deliver-gate.sh` does:
selecting one PR too many means labelling a healthy delivery `needs-human` and halting it, so
the rule needs tests (`scripts/deliver_stall_candidates_test.go`). Excluding `deliver:paused` is
the case most easily missed — a paused delivery goes quiet by design, so it crosses any quiet
threshold every time, and sweeping it would overrule the human who paused it.

## deliver-issue-refinements.sh — the design refinements in an issue's comment thread

Prints the comments on an issue that carry authority over its **body**, oldest first, and says so
explicitly when there are none. Read before planning any PR — see
[docs/contributing/pr-workflow.md](../docs/contributing/pr-workflow.md#comments-can-refine-the-body)
Step 1.5 for the rule and
[docs/contributing/issue-comment-authority.md](../docs/contributing/issue-comment-authority.md) for
the decision behind it.

```bash
scripts/deliver-issue-refinements.sh 1782            # read the thread from GitHub
scripts/deliver-issue-refinements.sh --render p.json # render a prepared payload, no network
```

An issue body is written once; the design is then refined in comments and nobody rewrites the body.
So a plan made from the body alone builds an out-of-date spec faithfully — #1706's body proposes a
shape its own thread later replaced, and the replacement is what was built.

**A comment counts iff its author holds `admin`/`write`/`maintain`** on this repository, the same
boundary `/approve-issue-for-pr-delivery` uses; bot, minimized, empty and slash-command-only comments
are dropped. `authorAssociation` is deliberately not the signal — this repository's maintainer
reports `CONTRIBUTOR`. The selection law is the sibling `deliver-issue-refinements.jq`, kept as a
separate file for the same reason `deliver-stall-candidates.jq` is: it is the part with tests
(`scripts/deliver_issue_refinements_test.go`), and both failure directions are expensive — selecting
too little ignores a correction someone wrote down, selecting too much lets a stranger's comment
steer an agent run holding credentials.

Exit 0 when the thread was read (with or without refinements), 2 on a usage error, and **3 when the
read failed** — in which case the digest's first line is `REFINEMENT-READ-FAILED` rather than empty,
because empty output reads exactly like "this issue has no refinements".

## deliver-trusted-comments.sh — the comment text an AI flow is allowed to read

Prints the discussion on an issue or PR with every comment from an author who holds **no** write
access on this repository removed, and says how many it withheld. `--json` emits the same trusted set
as structured data for the qa-review Python consumers.

```bash
scripts/deliver-trusted-comments.sh --pr 1807         # conversation + reviews + inline comments
scripts/deliver-trusted-comments.sh --issue 1806      # conversation comments
scripts/deliver-trusted-comments.sh --json --pr 1807  # same trusted set, as JSON
scripts/deliver-trusted-comments.sh --render p.json   # render a prepared payload, no network
```

**Why (#1806).** *Who* may trigger the AI flows was already gated to admin/maintain/write; *what*
they then read was not — and this repository is public, so any GitHub user can comment on any issue
or PR. An agent cannot reliably separate "context" from "instruction", so that text is a
prompt-injection surface into flows on a self-hosted runner with credentials (and, in the correction
phase, `contents: write`). This script is the structural half that stops a stranger's text reaching
the agent; the prompts' "treat comments as data" is the behavioural half for the text that IS shown.

**Wired STRUCTURALLY into the flows we control:** in `deliver-verify.yml` and `deliver-correct.yml`
a workflow step runs this from the trusted default-branch checkout before the agent and writes the
digest to `$RUNNER_TEMP/trusted-comments.md`; the agent reads that file and never fetches comments
itself. The qa-review `answerer.py`/`adjudicator.py` read it (`--json`) instead of
`gh … --json comments`. `claude.yml` is **out of scope** (#1806): it runs `claude-code-action` in tag
mode, which assembles comment context itself, leaving no seam for the filter — a documented
limitation. See the comment-text section in
[docs/contributing/standards/agent-trust.md](../docs/contributing/standards/agent-trust.md).

It covers **all three** sources the flows read — conversation comments, PR reviews, and PR inline
(line-level) review comments — because a filter on one endpoint leaves the others open. Unlike
`deliver-issue-refinements.sh` it **keeps** the automation's own comments, labelled `[automation]`
(the `DELIVER-VERDICT` / `QA-VERDICT` markers the correction phase works from); human write-access
entries are labelled `[write access]`. It never refuses — it continues on the trusted subset and
reports the count withheld; excluded authors are named on **stderr** (and the workflow log) but not
in the digest, because a login is attacker-chosen text and the agent only needs the count.

Exit 0 when the discussion was read, 2 on a usage error, and **3 when the read failed** — first line
`COMMENT-READ-FAILED` rather than empty, because empty output reads like "nobody has commented" and an
agent that concludes that returns a clean verdict on findings it never saw. The selection law is the
sibling `deliver-trusted-comments.jq`, tested by `scripts/deliver_trusted_comments_test.go`; the
wiring into the flows by `scripts/deliver_trusted_comments_wiring_test.go`.

## lib-gh-write-access.sh — the write-access trust boundary (sourced, not run)

The repository's one implementation of "does this comment author hold write access?", plus the
bounded `gh` wrapper (SIGTERM then SIGKILL) every such lookup runs under. Sourced by
`deliver-issue-refinements.sh` and `deliver-trusted-comments.sh`, which need the same answer for two
questions — *whose design opinion overrides an issue body* and *whose text may an agent read at all*.
One copy, so the 404-vs-403 split cannot drift: a 404 is GitHub answering "not a collaborator", while
a 401/403/429/5xx or a deadline expiry means the caller **could not ask** and must fail closed. A
caller defines `degrade`, `SELF`, `REPO` and `TMP` before sourcing it.

## deliver-author-gate.sh — may an AI flow run on this author's content?

The single decision behind the container-level author gate (#1813): given one login, decide whether
an AI flow may run on content that login authored. Every AI flow (the delivery loop's
implement/verify/correct, interactive `@claude`, `/blis-pr-review`) calls it so the trust rule has
one definition rather than four, and it is invoked from a **checkout pinned to the default branch at
the workspace root**, placed before any event/delivery checkout — never a PR/delivery-ref copy, which
the author could replace.

```bash
scripts/deliver-author-gate.sh octocat                 # probe the login via gh
scripts/deliver-author-gate.sh --permission write alice # decide from a given permission, no network
```

The law matches `deliver-issue-refinements.sh`: allowed iff the author holds `admin`/`write`/`maintain`.
Two single-author differences: `github-actions[bot]`/`claude[bot]` are trusted **without** a probe
(the delivery loop's own PRs/issues are bot-authored, and the permission endpoint 404s for a bot
login), and the exit codes distinguish outcomes the callers must not conflate — **0** allowed, **1**
a definitive denial (clean 404 / `read` / `none`), **3** a probe failure (5xx/403/network/deadline)
that fails closed **and loud**, `2` usage. The bounded-`gh` watchdog is the same one the sibling
uses, so a stalled probe cannot hang a job. Tested by `scripts/deliver_author_gate_test.go`
(decision, via a `gh` stub + the `--permission` seam) and `scripts/deliver_author_gate_wiring_test.go`
(each workflow runs it from the trusted checkout and gates the agent on it).

## catalog-load-gate.sh — the strict catalog-load CI gate (R1/C6)

Loads **every** entry in the authoritative [`blis-catalog`](https://github.com/inference-sim/blis-catalog)
through the same loader code path `blis run` uses, and fails on any rejection. C6 says there is *no
validate command* — the simulator validates whatever it reads and fails naming the file and the
problem — so the gate is this script driving `cmd.TestCatalogStrictLoad_RealCatalog`, not a
subcommand and not a bespoke validator that could accept what a run rejects (#1750).

```bash
scripts/catalog-load-gate.sh                       # clone the pinned revision and load it
BLIS_CATALOG=~/blis-catalog scripts/catalog-load-gate.sh   # load a checkout you already have
```

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `BLIS_CATALOG` | *(unset)* | An existing catalog checkout to load. When set, nothing is cloned and the revision is whatever that checkout holds — for a local run against a work-in-progress catalog. |
| `CATALOG_REPO` | the blis-catalog GitHub URL | Clone source. The tests point it at a throwaway local repository, so they stay offline. |
| `CATALOG_REVISION` | a pinned 40-hex SHA | Revision to check out. |
| `CATALOG_CHECKOUT` | a fresh `mktemp -d` | Where to clone. |
| `GATE_TIMEOUT` | `5m` | `go test -timeout`. |

The revision is **pinned, not floating**: a green run must mean "this commit loads *that* catalog".
Tracking the catalog's default branch would let an unrelated catalog commit redden an unrelated PR and
would make a past green run unreproducible — so adopting catalog changes is a `CATALOG_REVISION` bump
in its own PR, which is then the review of the catalog change. `scripts/catalog_load_gate_test.go`
fails if the default stops being a 40-hex SHA.

Two failure modes are why this is a tested script rather than an inline workflow step: the load test
**skips** when `BLIS_CATALOG` never reaches it (so a local `go test ./...` needs no catalog checkout)
and `go test` reports a skip as a **pass** — so the script fails on a `--- SKIP:` line for the
top-level test, and also requires its `--- PASS:` line, which catches a `-run` pattern that matched
no test at all. Both patterns are anchored to the test name: an unanchored `--- SKIP` would match a
skipped *subtest* (go test indents those) and fail a load that ran fine.

**Wiring is a pending human step.** The `catalog-load` job that calls this script is quoted verbatim
in the script header but is **not yet in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`** — the delivery loop's
`GITHUB_TOKEN` has no `workflows` permission ([automated-delivery.md](../docs/contributing/automated-delivery.md)),
so a human must paste it. Until then the authoritative-catalog load is an on-demand command, and
only the committed fixture catalog is loaded on every PR (by `go test ./cmd/...`). Adding the job —
and, if the check should block merges, marking it required in branch protection — is a merge
precondition for #1750, not something this script can enforce from inside the repository.

## archon-plan-resolve.sh — find and extract a declared archon plan

Finds the first `archon-plan: <path>` line in the declaration text and extracts that file
out of git. Tested by `scripts/archon_plan_resolve_test.go`.

```bash
scripts/archon-plan-resolve.sh <base-ref> <head-ref> <decl-file> <out-file>
```

Prints one `key=value` per line and exits 0 in all three cases (exit 2 only on a usage error):

| Output | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `status=none` | no declaration found — the normal case for a bug fix |
| `status=resolved` + `plan_path`, `plan_source` (`base`/`head`), `plan_commit` | `<out-file>` written |
| `status=error` + `plan_path`, `message` | declared but unusable |

The declared path comes from a PR or issue body, so it is untrusted. It must be
repository-relative, end in `.json`, be at most 256 characters, and match
`[A-Za-z0-9._/-]+` with no `..`; anything echoed back has out-of-allowlist characters
replaced, so a rejected path cannot inject markdown or a workflow command into the comment.

Extraction uses git plumbing against an explicit commit — never the filesystem. The
workflow is `issue_comment`-triggered, so the working tree holds the default branch rather
than the PR: a filesystem read would find the wrong file and would let a traversal escape
the repository. The object's type, mode, and size are gated (regular-file blob, non-empty,
at most 1 MiB) before any bytes are written.

Base is tried before head so a hole PR cannot be graded against a plan it rewrote. A base
copy that exists but is unusable, and a commit that is not reachable locally, are both hard
errors rather than a fall-through to the head copy — `git ls-tree` is silent for both, and
either one would quietly hand grading back to the PR.

## find-saturation.sh — Rate-sweep saturation finder

Drives `blis run` across a configurable rate sweep against a chosen
`(model, hardware, TP, workload)` configuration. For each rate it:

1. Runs `blis run` once with the **detector bank** (`--detectors all`), which
   fans one deterministic replay out to every post-hoc detector (composite,
   threshold, backlog-drift, peak-rate) in a single pass (#1519, #1614).
2. Reads each detector's final verdict from the run's `--saturation-report`
   (the `"final"` detector→label map, #1517).
3. Extracts throughput, latency, and all detector verdicts into a single CSV row.

The output reproduces the validation table against the catalog's
`models/llama-3.1-70b-instruct/`. Pointing it at any other configuration
should produce a comparable table with the same column shape.

### Quick start

```bash
# Default: Llama-3.1-70B / TP=8 / H100 / chatbot, sweeps 0.5..100 req/s
./scripts/find-saturation.sh

# Llama-2-7B / TP=1, narrower sweep
MODEL=meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf \
  CATALOG=blis-catalog \
  TP=1 RATES="2 4 6 8 10 12 16 20" \
  ./scripts/find-saturation.sh

# Custom workload, slower coarse sweep
WORKLOAD=summarization NUM_REQUESTS=2000 RATES="4 6 8 10 12" \
  ./scripts/find-saturation.sh

# Only one detector (skip the bank)
DETECTORS=composite ./scripts/find-saturation.sh

# A different catalogued model
MODEL=qwen/qwen3-14b CATALOG=blis-catalog TP=1 \
  ./scripts/find-saturation.sh
```

### Inputs (all environment variables)

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `MODEL` | `meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct` | HuggingFace-style model name |
| `CATALOG` | `blis-catalog` | Model catalog clone root (holds `models/<short-name>/config.json` per model). Passed as `--catalog`; required since #1731 — there is no default and no search path. Point it at a checkout of the blis-catalog repository. A model with no entry is refused, never fetched. |
| `HARDWARE` | `H100` | GPU type passed to `--hardware` |
| `TP` | `8` | Tensor parallelism degree |
| `WORKLOAD` | `chatbot` | Built-in preset (chatbot/summarization/contentgen/multidoc) |
| `LATENCY_MODEL` | `trained-physics` | `--latency-model` backend |
| `NUM_REQUESTS` | `6000` | `--num-requests` per rate |
| `HORIZON_US` | `600000000` (600s) | `--horizon` per rate |
| `DETECTORS` | `all` | `--detectors` selection (`all`, or a comma-list like `composite,threshold`) |
| `FINAL_WINDOW` | `10s` | `--saturation-final-window` (trailing window for the plurality vote) |
| `RATES` | `0.5 1 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 20 30 40 50 60 80 100` | Space-separated rate sweep |
| `SEED` | `42` | RNG seed |
| `OUT_DIR` | `results/saturation-<ts>-<pid>` | Output directory |

### Outputs

```
$OUT_DIR/
├── summary.csv                          # one row per rate (12 columns)
├── rate-{R}.json                        # blis run stdout (metrics)

└── rate-{R}.saturation.json             # {"final":{...},"trace":[...]} report
```

`summary.csv` columns:

| Column | Source | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `intended_rate` | input flag | What `--rate` was set to |
| `sustained_throughput` | `injected_requests / vllm_estimated_duration_s` | Actual req/s injected over total sim time |
| `goodput_rps` | `responses_per_sec` | Completed req/s |
| `goodput_vs_intended` | `goodput_rps / intended_rate` | Ratio; <100% indicates the engine couldn't sustain intended load |
| `timeout_frac` | `timed_out_requests / injected_requests` | Fraction culled by client timeout |
| `e2e_p99_ms` / `ttft_p99_ms` | metrics | Tail latencies |
| `still_queued` / `still_running` | metrics | End-state residue |
| `composite_verdict` | report `.final.composite` | STABLE / BACKLOGGED / OVERLOADED |
| `threshold_verdict` | report `.final.threshold` | STABLE / OVERLOADED (binary) |
| `backlog_drift_verdict` | report `.final["backlog-drift"]` | STABLE / BACKLOGGED / OVERLOADED |
| `peak_rate_verdict` | report `.final["peak-rate"]` | STABLE / BACKLOGGED / OVERLOADED |

A detector that is not in `DETECTORS` shows `n/a` in its column.

### Reading the output

A clean read of "where does this configuration saturate?" looks like:

```
intended_rate  goodput_rps  ratio  composite     threshold   backlog-drift  peak-rate
0.5            0.50         100%   STABLE        STABLE      STABLE
…
60             56.29        94%    BACKLOGGED    STABLE      BACKLOGGED
80             64.49        81%    OVERLOADED    OVERLOADED  OVERLOADED   ← knee
100            64.76        65%    OVERLOADED    OVERLOADED  OVERLOADED
```

The saturation knee is the first rate where `ratio` falls below ~100% OR a
detector's final verdict flips to `OVERLOADED`. The detectors measure
different things — composite blends rate deficit with a latency trend,
threshold is a pure mean-E2E cutoff, and backlog-drift tracks the slope of
in-flight — so a rate where they disagree (e.g. backlog-drift flags
`BACKLOGGED` while threshold is still `STABLE`) is itself informative: the queue
is growing before mean latency crosses the cutoff.

### Tips

- **Build once.** The script auto-builds `./blis` if absent. Subsequent runs
  reuse it; remove the binary to force a rebuild.
- **Pin the seed.** Two seeds at the same rate land in different parts of
  Poisson variance and look noisy. Default `SEED=42` keeps every step of the
  sweep on the same noise realization.
- **Don't trust a single rate.** Saturation curves are smoother than they look;
  the knee is a transition zone (~3-5 rate steps wide). Look at three rates
  before and after the suspected knee.
- **Fine sweep after coarse.** First pass with the default 17 rates spanning
  200×; identify the knee zone (e.g., between 60 and 80); then re-run with
  `RATES="62 64 66 68 70 72 74 76 78"` to pin the exact transition.
- **Tune the final window.** `FINAL_WINDOW` controls how much of the run's tail
  the plurality vote considers. Use `--horizon` to end observation while load is
  still active — if you let all requests drain, the tail looks STABLE.

### Running on a custom configuration

The script's defaults match the reference validation experiment so anyone can
reproduce that exact table. To validate any other configuration, override the
relevant variables:

```bash
# Example: probe Mixtral-8x7B FP8 on 4×H100 TP=4 with summarization workload
MODEL=mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 \
  CATALOG=blis-catalog \
  TP=4 WORKLOAD=summarization \
  RATES="2 4 8 16 24 32 40 48" \
  ./scripts/find-saturation.sh
```

If your model isn't in the catalog, drop its `config.json` into
`$CATALOG/models/<your-model-slug>/config.json` (`$CATALOG` is a checkout of the
[`blis-catalog`](https://github.com/inference-sim/blis-catalog) repository, or any scratch
clone of that layout). BLIS does not fetch configs at run time — a model with no entry is
refused, naming the path its entry belongs at.

### Dependencies

- `bash` 4+
- `jq` (for JSON parsing)
- `bc` (for ratio arithmetic)
- `column` (for the final pretty-print; falls back gracefully if missing)
- `go` (auto-builds `./blis` on first run)
