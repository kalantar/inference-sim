// #1790: the delivery PR must record WHO ran `/approve-issue-for-pr-delivery`.
//
// The implement phase already knows — `check-permissions` gates on `github.actor` — but never put
// it on the PR. Every delivery PR is authored by `app/claude`, so with several in flight nobody can
// tell who started which, and the approver is not subscribed to the thread: they see none of the
// verdicts, correction rounds or needs-human stops that follow.
//
// WHY THE WORKFLOW HALF MAY TRAVEL AS A PATCH. The delivering credential is a GitHub App
// installation token without the `workflows` permission, and both `git push` and the contents API
// refuse it ("refusing to allow a GitHub App to create or update workflow … without `workflows`
// permission"). #1715 hit the same wall and set the convention followed here: the workflow edit is
// committed as an appliable patch, and the guard test holds the contract over whichever of the two
// currently carries it — asserting the real workflow the moment a human applies the patch, with no
// edit to this file.
//
// UNLIKE #1715's guard, this one does not match the patch's added lines. It reconstructs the
// POST-IMAGE by applying the diff, then asserts against that. Added-line matching cannot see step
// ORDER or parse the result as YAML, and — the reason that matters most here — it cannot tell a
// stale patch from a good one. Applying the diff checks every context line against the workflow as
// it stands today, so a patch that has drifted out of applying fails here rather than at the moment
// someone tries to land it.

// touches anything else is refused rather than partially applied (see below). It is a parameter
// rather than a constant because #1834 carries a second pending workflow patch, against
// deliver-verify.yml, through this same reconstruction.
//
// Deliberately hand-rolled rather than shelling out to `git apply`. The point of this test is the
// staleness check, and reconstructing the post-image in memory is what lets the assertions below
// parse it as YAML and check step ORDER — neither of which added-line matching against the patch
// can do. It also lets the parser REFUSE a patch that touches any file other than the workflow
// (below), where `git apply` would just apply it. (`git` is in fact available in this CI group; the
// reason is the two properties above, not its absence.)
//
// Parsing starts at `diff --git`, never at the top of the file: `git format-patch` puts the commit
// MESSAGE first, and this change's own message contains bullet lines beginning with `-` that would
// otherwise be read as removals.
//
// Both inputs are normalized to LF first. A `git format-patch` diff carries LF line endings; if the
// checked-out workflow has CRLF (a Windows checkout, or `core.autocrlf`), otherwise-identical
// context lines would compare unequal and a good patch would be reported as stale. The post-image
// is therefore LF-only. That is sound BECAUSE it is never written back to disk — the callers parse
// it as YAML in memory and assert on step order — so it is a comparison form, not a replacement
// file. Do not start writing the result out without reinstating the original line endings.
//
// WHERE IT STOPS SHORT OF `git apply`, stated so a caller does not over-trust it: it takes a single
// file, refuses anything else, needs exact context (no fuzz, no offset search, no `-R`), ignores
// index/mode/rename headers, and does not do binary or empty-file creation/deletion. It DOES honour
// `\ No newline at end of file` on both sides, checking the old side's claim against the file and
// reproducing the new side's state (#1834 G4). Within that subset a patch it accepts is one `git
// apply` accepts, and a post-image it returns is the one `git apply` would write — which is what
// the staleness guard needs. Outside it, the helper errors rather than guessing.

// applyUnifiedDiff and parseHunkHeader are the load-bearing parts of the guard above: the whole
// staleness contract rests on the parser applying a good patch and rejecting a bad one. If it
// silently mis-applied a hunk, a drifted patch could still reconstruct into something that contains
// the recorder step and the guard would pass on a patch that no longer lands. The tests above only
// ever feed it the one real patch, so these exercise the parser directly against the edge cases that
// one patch does not — additions at EOF, blank-line context, multiple hunks, omitted counts, line
// endings, and each way a patch is supposed to be refused.

// workflowDiff wraps hunk text in the single-file `diff --git` header applyUnifiedDiff requires, so a
// test case only has to spell out the hunks.
