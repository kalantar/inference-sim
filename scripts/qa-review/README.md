# scripts/qa-review/

Cross-vendor two-agent PR review, vendored from the `/qa-review` prototype
(RFC #1603). A **questioner** on one model family generates probing questions;
an isolated **answerer** on a different family investigates the actual PR-head
code to answer them; a **renderer** turns the pair into a Markdown report and a
PASS/BLOCK verdict; an **adjudicator** re-checks prior blocking findings against
the author's defence on a re-verify round.

The decorrelated second opinion (a different vendor than the Opus code-writer
and the Sonnet reviewer) is the point — it catches what a single-vendor review
misses.

These scripts are **stdlib-only Python 3** (`urllib`, `json`, `re`, `argparse`,
`subprocess`) — no third-party dependency, no `requirements.txt`. They talk to
the LiteLLM proxy over its OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` surface.

> **Status.** #1714 vendored the tooling and tested its deterministic surface.
> #1715 made the verdict a **blocking gate signal**: `scripts/deliver-gate.sh`
> now requires `QA_VERDICT ∈ {PASS, BLOCK, MISSING}` as a seventh fail-closed
> input, and `deliver-verify.yml` runs the questioner + answerer against an
> ephemeral read-only PR-head worktree with `--no-exec`.
>
> Both halves are now live in this PR: the gate change and the `deliver-verify.yml`

> read `QA_VERDICT`. Because the delivery agent's GitHub App token has no `workflows`
> permission, the workflow half was applied by a `workflows`-scoped push rather than by
> the agent; `scripts/deliver_qa_verdict_test.go` holds the contract over the live
> workflow.
>
> #1716 completes the epic (#1717) by making the re-verify **adjudicate-only**: round 0
> keeps the full questioner+answerer pass, every later round runs only `adjudicator.py`
> over the findings that pass already raised. Both halves are live — the report-comment
> selection (below) and the workflow wiring (the `Run qa-review adjudication` step gated on
> the round counter). As with the #1715 half, the workflow change was applied by a
> `workflows`-scoped push (the delivery agent's token lacks the permission);
> `scripts/deliver_qa_adjudicate_test.go` holds the contract over the live workflow.
>
> #1792 closes the round-0 completeness gap that the epic surfaced: the answerer had none of the
> tools needed to see the closing issue or the diff, so fixed policy question F1 ("does this fully
> implement the issue?") was always a blocking `CANNOT_ANSWER` and the loop's qa-review could
> never `PASS` from round 0. The answerer now carries the **same read-only `gh_issue`/`pr_diff`

> numbers reach the prompt; `scripts/deliver_qa_verdict_test.go` pins the workflow wiring.

## The pieces

| Script | Role | stdout |
|---|---|---|
| `questioner.py` | probing-question generator (cross-vendor) | `{"model", "questions":[{id,topic,question}]}` |
| `answerer.py` | agentic, read-only answerer over the worktree | `[{id,status,answer,evidence,note}]` |
| `render_report.py` | report renderer (+ optional PR posting) | the Markdown report |
| `adjudicator.py` | author-defence re-check (used by #1716) | the adjudication report |
| `_http.py` | the one shared retrying chat-completions client (#1833) | — (library) |

### _http.py

Every completion the three agents make goes through one `post_chat_completion`
here, wrapped in a **bounded retry with backoff**. They each used to issue their
own single `urllib.request.urlopen` with no `timeout=` and no retry, so one
transient gateway error crashed the script: on PR #1832 a `504` killed the
answerer ~30 minutes into its tool loop, which wrote no `QA-VERDICT` marker, so
the L1 gate read `QA_VERDICT=MISSING` and stopped a fully-green delivery for a
human. Re-dispatching cleared it — the failure self-heals; the client simply
could not retry itself.

The retry is on the **single failed call**, with the caller's `messages` history
untouched, so an answerer that trips a `504` on turn 18 resumes at turn 18
rather than discarding seventeen turns of tool work — and the retry does not
spend a turn out of `MAX_TOOL_TURNS`.

- **Retried:** HTTP `408`/`429` and every `5xx`, plus connection-level failures
  (`URLError`, socket timeout, connection reset, a disconnect mid-read), plus a
  **response body that will not decode** — a proxy blip can answer `200` with an
  HTML error page or a body truncated mid-JSON, which urllib reports as a
  perfectly clean response, so the decode failure is the only evidence that this
  was not the model's answer.
- **Not retried:** every other `4xx`. `400`/`401`/`403`/`404` are deterministic
  configuration errors (bad payload, wrong key, unknown model) — retrying them
  cannot succeed and only burns CI wall-clock. The **gateway's own response body
  is written to stderr** before the error is re-raised: the status line says
  `Bad Request`, the body says which field, model or limit was rejected.
- `Retry-After` wins when present, and is honoured **in full** — both the
  delay-seconds and the HTTP-date form, never shortened. The absolute form is
  differenced against the response's own `Date` header when it has one, so both
  timestamps come from the gateway and a skewed runner clock cannot distort the
  window. An unusable header (a negative count, an unparseable word, a deadline
  already past) falls through to exponential backoff with half jitter, i.e. a
  wait drawn from `[w/2, w]`.
- **The waiting is bounded in aggregate, not per wait** (`QA_HTTP_MAX_TOTAL_WAIT`,
  900s). A delay that does not fit the remaining budget **ends the retry loop**
  rather than being truncated: retrying earlier than the gateway asked earns the
  same error and spends an attempt for nothing. That is also a firmer bound on a
  hostile `Retry-After: 99999` than a per-wait cap was — no wait happens at all.
- Every attempt carries an **explicit `timeout=`**, so a hung connection fails
  into a retry instead of hanging the review.
- **Fail-closed on genuine exhaustion.** When the attempt budget (or the wait
  budget) runs out the last error is re-raised after a stderr diagnostic naming
  it and the gateway's body, so the script still exits without a marker and the
  gate still reads `MISSING` ⇒ `needs-human`. Only the single-blip hair-trigger
  is gone; a sustained outage still stops for a human.

### questioner.py

Emits three **fixed** policy questions (`F1..F3`) verbatim — issue-implementation
completeness, documentation currency, stale comments — plus model-generated,
**topic-seeded** questions (`G1..`) across eight topics: correctness,
invariants, rules, parity, tests, rationale, scope, errors. One
`POST /chat/completions`.

Cross-vendor models routinely emit regex/shell fragments like `\s` inside JSON
string values, which are invalid JSON escapes. `repair_json()` escapes any
backslash that is not part of a valid JSON escape, leaving well-formed `\\`
pairs untouched, so the payload parses.

### answerer.py

Runs an OpenAI-compatible function-calling loop with **read-only tools
sandboxed to `--worktree`**: `read_file`, `grep`, `list_dir`, and — unless
`--no-exec` — a guarded `go build`/`go test`/`go vet`. It investigates the
PR-head code and returns, per question, a `status ∈ {CONFIDENT, CANNOT_ANSWER,
FLAW_FOUND}` with an `answer`, `evidence` (file:line or a repro), and an
optional non-blocking `note`.

**Issue-completeness tools (`gh_issue` / `pr_diff`, #1792).** The worktree tools
can read the PR-head code but cannot see *the issue the PR is meant to satisfy*
or *what actually changed*, so the fixed policy question F1 ("does this PR fully
implement the issue it closes?") was unanswerable from the worktree alone — it
fell to `CANNOT_ANSWER`, which is blocking, so the delivery loop's own qa-review
could never reach `PASS` from round 0. The answerer now carries the **same
read-only `gh_issue`/`pr_diff` tools the adjudicator already has** — `gh_issue`
reads the closing issue's acceptance criteria + comments, `pr_diff` reads the
base→head diff. They are ported verbatim from `adjudicator.py`, and because they
are read-only `gh` network calls (not PR-code execution) they stay under
`--no-exec`, which continues to drop only the code-executing `go` tool. The
answerer is told the PR number and the closing-issue number (`--pr` / `--issue`)
so it knows which to query; the system prompt directs it to consult them for
F1/F2/F3 but **not** to answer from the diff alone when the surrounding code
decides the answer — verify against the real code. `QA_REPO` targets the calls.

**Comments are read WRITE-ACCESS-FILTERED (#1806).** `gh_issue` fetches the issue
HEAD (title/body) directly, but its **comments** — and the PR comments
`adjudicator.py`'s `fetch_comments` selects the prior findings from — are read
through `scripts/deliver-trusted-comments.sh`, not `gh … --json comments`. This
repository is public, so a stranger's comment on the issue or PR is a
prompt-injection surface into this LLM; the filter keeps only comments whose
author holds write access (plus this repo's automation) and a read failure
surfaces as an `COMMENT-READ-FAILED` marker rather than an empty thread. See the
comment-text section in
[docs/contributing/standards/agent-trust.md](../../docs/contributing/standards/agent-trust.md).

The tool loop has a finite budget (`MAX_TOOL_TURNS = 24`). Exhausting it is a
normal outcome, not an error, so the loop **degrades instead of crashing**: it
honors a final answer array the assistant already produced, and otherwise
reports every question `CANNOT_ANSWER`. That status is blocking, so a run that
ran out of turns can never silently `PASS`. Exhaustion is always logged to
stderr.

### render_report.py

Verdict is **`BLOCK` iff any answer status ∈ {FLAW_FOUND, CANNOT_ANSWER}**, else
`PASS`. The output is a one-line verdict **header**
(`## qa-review — PR #N: ✅ PASS` / `⛔ BLOCK`), a subtitle, the full untruncated
`ID | Topic | Result | Question | Answer` table, an **Items to fix** section
(blocking findings + evidence), and an **Important to consider** section
(non-blocking notes). `default_banner(qmodel, amodel)` is built from the actual
models so it can't drift.

The verdict lives in the header emoji — it is **not** a trailing machine marker.
Deriving the `QA-VERDICT: PASS|BLOCK` gate marker from this output is #1715's
job, not this tooling's.

### adjudicator.py

Reads the most recent qa-review **report** comment's **Items to fix**
(`select_report_comment` + `parse_items_to_fix`)
and every later comment (the author's responses), then per prior blocking
finding verifies with read-only worktree tools + `gh_issue` + `pr_diff` and
returns `RESOLVED` / `WAIVED_JUSTIFICATION` / `WAIVED_DEFERRED` / `STILL_OPEN`.
It **defaults to `STILL_OPEN`** (skeptical) and, on a genuine
acceptance-criterion interpretation fork, returns `STILL_OPEN` and asks the
author to pin the interpretation rather than guessing. The aggregate verdict is
`BLOCK` iff **any finding is `STILL_OPEN` or left un-adjudicated**, and is
emitted on **stderr** as `[adjudication verdict: PASS|BLOCK]` (not a PR marker —
#1716 derives the gate marker).

Its tool loop degrades on exhaustion the same way the answerer's does, to
`STILL_OPEN` for every prior finding — so running out of turns blocks rather
than clearing a finding it never actually adjudicated.

**Which comment supplies the prior findings (#1716).** Selection is structural,
not a substring search: a comment qualifies only if it *is* a rendered report —
an **unquoted, unfenced** `## qa-review — PR #` heading **and** an
`### Items to fix` section (fenced code blocks and `>` blockquotes are ignored,
because that is how a comment quotes a report it is discussing) — and, when
`--report-author` / `QA_REPORT_AUTHOR` is set, only if that login posted it. The
author restriction is strict: on a public repository, anything looser lets a
commenter supply a report-shaped comment with an empty Items-to-fix section and
clear every outstanding finding. Since #1806 it is *defence in depth* rather than
the only barrier — every comment reaching the selection already cleared
`scripts/deliver-trusted-comments.sh`, which admits only this repository's
allowlisted automation logins and humans with write access.

**The two spellings of one App actor match (#1834).** The login is compared with
`same_login()`, so `github-actions` and `github-actions[bot]` are the same poster.
They are the same actor read through two APIs: the GraphQL projection behind `gh
pr view --json comments` reports the short form, REST — which the trusted-comments
filter uses since #1806 — reports the canonical suffixed one. An exact comparison
against the short form therefore stopped finding the adjudicator's *own* round-0
report the moment the read switched to REST, and every re-verify exited **3** (PR
#1832; the whole multi-round correction path was unusable). Tolerating both
spellings means a future source switch in either direction cannot silently
re-break it.

Two limits on that tolerance, both load-bearing:

- **The `[bot]` suffix is ignored only for a comment the filter labelled
  `automation`** — i.e. one whose author is on its canonical, suffix-keyed
  allowlist, which is positive evidence the poster really is the App. GitHub
  reserves the suffixed spelling for Apps but *not* the bare one, so a human can
  register `github-actions`; stripping the suffix unconditionally would have let
  that account satisfy a restriction written `github-actions[bot]`, turning
  `QA_REPORT_AUTHOR` from "the App posted this" into "some account with this stem
  did". A comment admitted for its author's **write access** is compared exactly,
  and a missing or unrecognised label fails closed.
- **Logins are compared case-insensitively, after trimming surrounding
  whitespace.** GitHub account identity is case-insensitive and no two accounts
  can differ by case alone, so folding case cannot conflate distinct actors; a
  login can never *contain* whitespace, so whitespace only ever arrives from the
  environment variable or command line that carried the value. Both would
  otherwise fail closed for an invisible reason — #1834's silent `needs-human`
  again. A value that folds away to nothing (`[bot]`, or whitespace only) matches
  **no** login rather than every App.

Finding **no** report comment is **not** a `PASS`: `fetch_comments` returns
`None` (distinct from `[]`, a real report with nothing blocking) and the tool
exits **3** with no verdict line at all, so no consumer can derive a marker from
a review that was never found. The pre-#1716 rule keyed off the last comment
*containing* the banner, so a self-review quoting it hijacked the selection and —
having no Items-to-fix section of its own — produced zero findings and a vacuous
`PASS` (observed on PR #1736).

## The `--no-exec` seam

`answerer.py` and `adjudicator.py` accept an **off-by-default `--no-exec`** flag
that drops the code-executing `go` tool from **both** the implementation map and
the advertised tool schema, leaving `read_file`/`grep`/`list_dir` and the
read-only `gh_issue`/`pr_diff` tools intact — **both agents** now carry the gh
tools (the answerer since #1792). It is a pure `tools_for(no_exec) -> (impl,
schema)` selector.

**Flag absent ⇒ the `go` tool is present ⇒ verbatim prototype behavior.** The
seam exists so #1715/#1716 can run the answerer/adjudicator on the self-hosted
runner while preserving `deliver-verify.yml`'s invariant that the PR's code is
never compiled or executed there.

## Orchestration

Two consumers drive these scripts in this same order: the delivery gate
(`.github/workflows/deliver-verify.yml`), and — on demand, for a human or agent —
the committed `qa-review` skill (`.claude/skills/qa-review/SKILL.md`), which shells
out to the scripts here rather than copying them, so it cannot drift from the gate.

1. Resolve the PR → materialize the PR head into a throwaway **read-only**
   worktree.
2. `questioner.py` → questions JSON.
3. `answerer.py --worktree <wt> --pr N --issue M` (optionally `--no-exec`),
   passing the PR + closing-issue numbers so its `gh_issue`/`pr_diff` tools can
   verify issue-completeness for F1 (#1792) → answers JSON.
4. `render_report.py --questions … --answers … --pr N [--post-to-pr]`.
5. Clean up the throwaway worktree.

For a re-verify round (#1716, adjudicate-only): skip the questioner/answerer and
run `adjudicator.py --worktree <wt> --pr N` against the prior findings + the
author's responses. (There is no `--adjudicate` flag; running `adjudicator.py`
instead of the questioner/answerer IS the adjudicate-only mode — the workflow
selects it by the round counter.)

## Environment surface

| Var | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | LiteLLM proxy base URL | — (required) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | proxy key; falls back to `LITELLM_KEY` | — (required) |
| `QA_QUESTIONER_MODEL` | questioner model | `gcp/gemini-3.6-flash` |
| `QA_ANSWERER_MODEL` | answerer model | `azure/gpt-5.6-sol` |
| `QA_ADJUDICATOR_MODEL` | adjudicator model | `azure/gpt-5.6-sol` |
| `QA_REPORT_AUTHOR` | adjudicator: only adjudicate a prior report posted by this comment author login (the App `[bot]` suffix is optional — #1834) | empty (any author) |
| `QA_REPO` | `owner/repo` for `gh` calls | `inference-sim/inference-sim` |
| `QA_REPO_DIR` | local clone the worktree is cut from | — |
| `QA_HTTP_TIMEOUT` | `_http.py`: per-attempt request timeout, seconds | `600` |
| `QA_HTTP_MAX_ATTEMPTS` | `_http.py`: total attempts including the first | `5` |
| `QA_HTTP_BACKOFF` | `_http.py`: first backoff, seconds, doubled per retry | `2` |
| `QA_HTTP_MAX_TOTAL_WAIT` | `_http.py`: total waiting allowed between attempts, seconds, across the whole call | `900` |

The `QA_HTTP_*` knobs are optional tuning only. An unusable value (not a
number, or non-positive) is reported on stderr and ignored rather than raised: a
typo'd knob must not be the thing that turns a review into `MISSING`.

## Tests

`scripts/qa_review_test.go` (`package scripts_test`) shells out to `python3`,
mirroring how `scripts/deliver_gate_test.go` shells out to `bash`, so every
qa-review test runs under `go test ./scripts/...` with no new test framework.
It covers only the **model-free** surface: `render_report.py`'s verdict rule and
output shape, `questioner.repair_json()`, `adjudicator.parse_items_to_fix()` and
its block rule, `adjudicator.fetch_comments()`'s report-comment selection
(including the quoting shapes that used to hijack it, and the fail-closed
refusal when no report exists), the `--no-exec` `tools_for()` seam for both agents
(now asserting the answerer carries the same read-only `gh_issue`/`pr_diff` set,
#1792), the answerer surfacing the `--pr`/`--issue` numbers into its prompt (#1792 —
`answerer_user_message` preamble structure plus a `main()` path that passes the
flags), and both agents' tool-loop exhaustion degradation (the one
`post_chat_completion` stub is the only model-dependent piece). The model-calling
paths need the live proxy and are not unit-tested here.

`_http.py`'s retry policy is covered too (#1833), and its probes mock one level
lower than the rest: they replace `_http.send` — the single named seam that
touches the network — and `_http.sleep`, rather than `post_chat_completion`,
which is the function under test. Pinned: retry-then-success for every transient
status, connection error and unparseable body; the retry re-sending the request
verbatim; `Retry-After` honoured in full in both forms (delay-seconds, HTTP-date
differenced against the response `Date`) and falling back to backoff on an
unusable value; the cumulative wait budget ending the loop rather than waiting a
truncated delay; the jittered exponential window; no retry at all on a `4xx`,
with the gateway's own body reaching stderr; the fail-closed re-raise and
diagnostic on exhaustion (including a body that never parses); that all three
agents share the one client; and that a mid-loop `504` resumes with its message
history intact without spending a tool turn.
