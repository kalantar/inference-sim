"""qa-review adjudicator — author-defence re-check (used by #1716).

Reads the most recent qa-review REPORT comment's "Items to fix"
(select_report_comment + parse_items_to_fix) and every later comment (the PR
author's responses), then adjudicates each prior blocking finding against the
author's defence and the current code.

Source-comment selection is structural, not a substring search: a comment
qualifies only if it IS a rendered report — an unquoted, unfenced
"## qa-review — PR #" heading AND an "### Items to fix" section — and, when
--report-author/QA_REPORT_AUTHOR is set, only if that login posted it (either
spelling of a GitHub App actor matches — see same_login, #1834). Keying
on the bare banner substring let a later comment that merely QUOTED it (a
self-review discussing the findings, or one pasting an example report inside
``` fences) hijack the selection; with no Items-to-fix section of its own that
comment yielded zero findings and a vacuous PASS — fail-OPEN on the one signal
the delivery gate treats as fail-closed (observed on PR #1736).

Per-finding verdict:
  RESOLVED               the finding is fixed in the current code.
  WAIVED_JUSTIFICATION   the author gave a valid reason it is not a defect.
  WAIVED_DEFERRED        legitimately deferred to a tracked follow-up.
  STILL_OPEN             not resolved / not validly waived (the default).

Skeptical default-block: an unrecognized or missing per-finding verdict counts
as STILL_OPEN. Ambiguity-pushback: on a genuine acceptance-criterion
interpretation fork, return STILL_OPEN and ask the author to pin the
interpretation rather than guessing.

Aggregate verdict: BLOCK iff ANY finding is STILL_OPEN or left un-adjudicated;
emitted on STDERR as "[adjudication verdict: PASS|BLOCK]" (not a PR marker —
#1716 derives the gate marker from that line).

Exit codes: 0 a verdict was emitted, 2 missing proxy configuration, 3 no prior
qa-review report comment to adjudicate (deliberately NOT a PASS: there is
nothing to re-check, so a verdict would be vacuous).

Env:

  QA_REPORT_AUTHOR      restrict the prior-report search to this comment
                        author login (empty = any author). Either spelling of a
                        GitHub App actor is accepted -- "github-actions" and
                        "github-actions[bot]" name the same poster (#1834).
