"""qa-review answerer — cross-vendor answerer (agentic, read-only).

Runs an OpenAI-compatible function-calling loop with read-only tools sandboxed
to ``--worktree``. The answerer investigates the actual PR-head code to answer
each probing question, and runs on a DIFFERENT model family than the questioner
(RFC #1603). To judge the fixed policy questions (does this PR fully implement
the issue it closes? etc.) it also has the read-only ``gh_issue`` (the closing
issue's acceptance criteria) and ``pr_diff`` (the base→head diff) tools — the
same ones the adjudicator uses — so completeness is verifiable in round 0
(#1792), while behavior is still checked against the ACTUAL code.

Tools:
  read_file(path[, start, end])   read a worktree file (optionally a line range)
  grep(pattern[, path])           ripgrep-style search of the worktree
  list_dir(path)                  list a worktree directory
  go(subcommand)                  run ``go build``/``go test`` (dropped by --no-exec)
  gh_issue(number)                read a GitHub issue + comments (acceptance criteria)
  pr_diff(number)                 read the PR base→head diff

read_file/grep/list_dir/go are confined to ``--worktree``; gh_issue/pr_diff are
read-only ``gh`` network calls against ``QA_REPO`` (mirroring the adjudicator).
The PR number and the closing issue number are given to the model (``--pr`` /
``--issue``) so it knows which to query.

Per-question contract: status in {CONFIDENT, CANNOT_ANSWER, FLAW_FOUND} plus
answer, evidence (file:line / repro), and an optional non-blocking note.

Env:
  OPENAI_BASE_URL      LiteLLM proxy base URL (required)
  OPENAI_API_KEY       proxy key; falls back to LITELLM_KEY
  QA_ANSWERER_MODEL    default azure/gpt-5.6-sol
  QA_REPO              owner/repo for gh_issue/pr_diff (default inference-sim/inference-sim)
  QA_HTTP_*            transport timeout/retry knobs — see _http.py

stdout: [{id,status,answer,evidence,note}]

different model generated the questions; you must answer them by investigating \
the ACTUAL code at the PR head, using the read-only tools provided. To judge the \
fixed policy questions (whether the PR fully implements the issue it closes, \
documentation currency, stale comments) you also have the read-only gh_issue tool \

base→head diff): consult them for F1/F2/F3, but do NOT answer from the diff alone \
when the surrounding code decides the answer — verify against the real code. Never \
trust the PR description over the code.

For each question:
  - Use the tools to gather concrete evidence (file:line ranges, exact values, \
a reproduction).
  - Decide a status:
      CONFIDENT      you verified the answer against the code.
      CANNOT_ANSWER  you could not gather enough evidence to decide.
      FLAW_FOUND     you found a real defect, regression, or unmet contract.
  - Cite evidence as file:line references or a concrete repro.
  - Optionally add a non-blocking `note` for a lesser observation.

CANNOT_ANSWER and FLAW_FOUND are BLOCKING; use them only with justification.

When finished with ALL questions, return ONLY a JSON array:
[{"id": "...", "status": "...", "answer": "...", "evidence": "...", \
"note": "..."}]

# edit both. A shared read-only-gh helper is a possible follow-up.

# `gh issue view --comments` exits non-zero with only a deprecation notice and never
# returns the acceptance criteria — the exact failure that would defeat the round-0
